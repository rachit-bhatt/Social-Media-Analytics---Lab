From what I heard, the two guys go to Italy (to meet their new relatives, I suppose) & wind up meeting Italian versions of themselves.\\ni loved the first one is it like the first one or not??\\n128238 170 7 0 7\\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same in Wabasha, Minnesota. The uncatchable fish named Catfish Hunter grows fatter. The wisecracks, zingers and put downs pile up like freshly raked leaves. And GRUMPY OLD MEN become grumpier in the sequel that\\'s \"pure delight, a wonderfully warmhearted comedy\" (David Sheehan, CBS-TV). Grabbing fishing rods and picking up where they left off, JACK LEMMON and WALTER MATTHAU reel in another comedy winner as GRUMPIER OLD MEN. ANN-MARGRET, DARYL HANNAH, KEVIN POLLACK and BURGESS MEREDITH also return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to reprise their roles. And SOPHIA LOREN is the newcomer whose plan to turn the town\\'s beloved bait shop into a ristorante sends the old boys into a tizzy. Be advised: a tizzy is very contagious. Get ready to laugh. And stay tuned for the outtakes, including \"man-sized manicotti!\" \"Better, funnier and even grumpier than the original.\"  - Joel Siegel, GOOD MORNING AMERICA/ABC-TV (c) 1995 Warner Bros.

RIP\\n@PanicSunday Yeah, just finished reading it and that\\'s right on. Seems like Disney wanted to make Tom the loverboy type and Huck the rebel, when in reality they were a lot more a like and I\\'d say Tom was more of the mastermind.\\nI\\'m such a pedophile.

I always see Tom as the one who is leader-like.\\nYa heroine at age 25, so sad.\\nOh my gosh, what happen to him?\\nI\\'ve been looking all over for this movie. So much better than that other one with elijah wood.

This movie\\'s the best!\\nHey! i remember this LOL!  but i was too little to see it >.<\\nbrad looks funny in this, i should see it!\\n@SuperMetalmania666 ahahhahahahahaha love it.\\nI was smart. I saw this movie before reading the actual books Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huck Finn. The movie didn\\'t ruin the books, and i had the image of Brad Renfro in my mind rather than some country hick. Probably the reason why i enjoyed the books so much.\\nThe very beginning is funny too.\\nWe saw this in English today. Huck is cute and fond of tripping Tom.\\n@TmSwyer: Ok, thanks for the explanation. I\\'ve just read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer but I haven\\'t seen any film based on the Twain\\'s book. This trailer is the first time I see any ecranisation of his works,\\n@asmodeus585 Just completely personality wise.  Tom was no push over, Huck followed him as oppose to the other way around.  In this one they make Tom too adorable as opposed to his realistic, mischievous and romantic kid.\\n@TmSwyer: Do you mean their looks or the plot? \\'Cause even in this trailer I see scenes that were descripted differently in the book. Becky would never hit Tom.\\nI read Adventures of Huck Finn and I\\'m in the middle of Tom Sawyer and I have to say, this trailer really makes them appear nothing like their book counter parts.\\nyou have a point there.\\nSee this one\\'s where Huck\\'s actually the right age.... Not like the Elijah Wood one, where he\\'s like 10....\\nEngine joe reminds me of tenzin from uncharted 2\\nyes i know that, passed away is the nicer way of saying that.\\nNo,He ODed on Heroin after being relesed from prison.\\nbrad renfro passed away\\ni miss the 90s\\nohmygod, it\\'s sooo upsetting to watch this and know that he\\'s dead ):\\nHe was truly good at what he accomplished though.\\nEspecially in this.

All the preperation is scarier than anything.\\n\\nBut Buffalo Bill from SotL is just as much of a copycat as \"Peter\". since he copied Ed Gein.\\nOr he\\'s carracter is based on Gein anyway.\\nNot just as disgusting tho.\\n\\n\"Peter\" at least chooses to copy the most infamous killers. ^_^\\nThe concept is definitely one that seems to work and has been used in other movies as well.  This picture certainly wouldn\\'t win any awards, but for some odd reason I enjoy watching it. Really enjoy this genre.  I can still see my mother so totally engrossed in it LOL.\\n\\n\\n\\nHmm...a remake might be a good idea.  I for one would love to see it.\\nTo each his own, I guess.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy mother was spellbound while watching this on TV.   I looked over and she was sitting on the edge of her seat during the entire second half.  Made me laugh because usually movies like this don\\'t grab her in that way.  One of the reasons might have been that Weaver\\'s character looked a lot like her when she was younger, so she associated with her.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlus I\\'m a fan of Holly Hunter..\\nBut your objective obseration and professional judgement don\\'t count, and you don\\'t matter.

Nothing like using the \"dream of the child molester\" as a vehicle for your fantasy. Has it totally escaped your mind what this man did? And more importantly, what Disney supported? DISNEY..of all companies! I know they love the gays, but standing by a child molester because they are so dedicated to supporting gays goes beyond the pale. AND THEY DID STAND BY HIM DURING ITS RELEASE! Even when the child that Salva molested protested Disney hiring Salva. Sorry, but Disney is no longer a \"kid friendly\" company.\\nI\\'m not a fan of this re-cut trailer simply because the cut and music has made this film seem like it\\'s a horror movie. It is deeper than this trailer is portraying it and is giving the wrong impression of its subject.\\nwould like to see a cameo by the superhero freakozoid\\ni totally misssed this gem.... thanks guys.... i left a love note... ksiksi\\nThis is racist\\nNicely done!!!\\nI like how powerful this cut made Powder look.\\xa0 Not meek.\\xa0 Good job.\\nIt not Rated R p13\\ni commune with powder on a regular basis. he is real. he is alive.\\nMy mom likes this movie.

They could even use the Russian/Latvian gangsters who kill the Julian Sands pimp character as these actual villains and it could end in a scene where like... Cage is in a raging blackout drunk and having the DTs and he kills all the bad guys in this Inspector Clouseau-like way by bumbling into the room in alcohol withdrawal spasming and shaking with the DTs and he fires a full clip at all the demons and aliens coming out of the walls (some of whom turn out to be actual russians) and he saves Sera and maybe Yuri!\\n\\nAnd then uh, he shoots himself in the head because (like John O\\'Brien) he sadly realized it\\'s more or less impossible to \"drink yourself to death\" and instead of dying you\\'re really condemning yourself to an cycle of alcohol addiction, intense drunkenness, hospital, withdrawal, maybe some clean time, then more intense drunkenness until the breaking point, followed by more withdrawal in a hospital or rehab, followed by... well, you get the cycle...\\n\\nSorry this film is so profound and this trailer so disengenuous it pisses me off\\nLeaving Las Vegas movie stripper shorthair blonde name???\\n2018 and this movie is still one of the great ones!\\nBest soundtrack hands down!\\nLeaving Las Vegas crushes my heart every time I see it. An awful and beautiful story about how two desperate people fall into a codependent relationship. There are few movies that are as good as this one.\\nThis movie actually did really good at the box office and it\\'s kinda funny to think that this trailer might\\'ve been a reason why so many people were attracted to see it.\\nEverytime I hear someone  talk about leaving las vegas, it always reminds of family guy where that liquor store guy and chris talk about movies.\\nOh shit!! My future!!\\nI love this movie one of the greatest movie of all times....\\nNicolas and Elizabeth have done a Great job\\nHe\\xa0won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.\\nTerrible trailer; great film.\\nbut does he really deserve an Oscar because of this movie !!!\\nbest movie EVER !\\nI plan on becoming an alchoholic and killing everyone\\nRecently saw this movie and it was one of the best ive seen in a long time.

Maybe the film would have been better if it actually was a quirky romantic comedy about a hot waitress lady falling in love with a funny guy who happens to be a drunk. As it is, the movie is just a depressing, unrealistic tale about an end stage alcoholic and a hooker (who both look like supermodels) just happening to live together while they both go about being idiots. What a shit movie, and a great trailer.\\nYour welcome!!!! :P\\nthx for the spoiler...\\nI know it seems strange to respond to my own comment but no one else did, so I had to eventually help myself.....\\nI really didn\\'t know who those two people were until I was relatively sober, then I had the common sense to look them up under the heading \"Leaving Las Vegas full cast\"\\nThe bartender is actor Graham Beckel.\\nThe \"pretty lady\" is actress Mariska Hargitay.\\nThank you both for your parts in this great movie.\\ni came here to drink myself to death,\\nfuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!\\nthis movie sucked...\\nPrecious scene at 0:13. \"I really wish you would come home with me, you\\'re so cute and I\\'m really good in bed too believe me...... no ?

I\\'m a male and my comment has nothing to do with feminism. It\\'s about how rapists piss me off.\\nIt\\'s because of how realistic that scene was. Didn\\'t you get mad when you watched that scene?\\nLoved the film so much I felt the same way. power of cinema.\\n\\nwhy would anything like the lack of a moral ever persuade you that something was worth hating?\\neasy ,man :) It\\'s just a film.\\nI love this movie. I can relate so well to cage in this.\\nI love this movie, but the reason I watch it over and over is because Elizabeth Shue is so hot. It is almost distracting.\\nRubius Nicolás puton hijo de guarra te observa\\ncomo nicolas cage de living las vegas\\nrubius!!!!!!!\\nNICHOLAS CAGE TE ESTA OBSERVANDO O_O\\nnicolas nunca muda mesmo kkk\\nIf this is good, what is awesome?\\nThis trailer prepares you for absolutely 0% of what you watch...\\nYou should watch Requiem for a dream. If you can make it through the whole film without feeling sick, then you\\'re seriously disturbed.\\nYou obviously didnt get the point then lol\\nMakes it look like a film about 2 people who turn their lives around when its anything but that. Also makes it seem alot more lighthearted than it actually is.\\nLol, Nic Cage worste actor.\\nThis film is the truth and notting but the truth.\\n\\ni miss voice overs in movie trailers\\nCouldn\\'t agree anymore!!\\nhe look like hunter s.thompson\\nA masterpiece. I needed a big shot of whiskey myself after watching this film.\\nYour comment made me weep. This movie is earth shattering for people that battle drinking and REALIZE IT. Thank you for saying it....... really hit home.\\nWatching this film you can distinguish between normal drinkers and alcoholics. A normal drinker watching this would be like \"Yeah! That guy\\'s having an awesome time, keep partying on!\" whereas an alcoholic would probably weep due to the brutal honest truth this film reveals about where their disease could take them.\\nYou get a LOL for that comment from me!! Good on ya!!!!!\\nWhat do you mean?\\nthe only thing i hate about this movie is the frat boys that raped sera get away with it. i wanted to see them get beat up, jailed, castrated, or even killed. i just wanted to reach through the screen and fuck those guys up. what a bunch of creeps, she didn\\'t want to have anal with them. so, they just go and beat the shit out of her, and fuck her up real bad. i wish all rapist would have their balls cut off.\\nAll these \\'90s trailers were always so upbeat for such depressing films!!!!\\nits lonely teardrops by michael mcdonald\\ndid you find it?\\nvery good movie\\n\\nwhat\\'s the soundtrack called by the way ???\\n\\nWhat type of movie is it?\\nAnyone who has ever been to the point of their lives where they believe that they will eventually die living that VERY point that brought them there should watch this movie, you are not alone.\\nand where the trailers spoil the whole movie\\nAre you sure that is the same movie?\\nNot a good trailer for this movie.\\nwhat a shitty commercial.\\nI\\'ve seen better. The movie was kinda boring honestly\\n@WorleyClarence no, u did it cuz ur a dumb fuck.\\n@TheEirinaki95 Come Rain, or Come Shine.\\noh hollywood, did you try to make a movie about turning a hoe into a housewife, even worse you used crazy nicolas to be the leading man. I can understand richard geare but nicolas cage? Well then thats called crack head falls in love with street hooker\\nIn the end credits: The events, characters, and firms depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual firms is purely concidental.\\nThe worst part about this trailer, is the narrator.\\n@roscoegino Haha good point :\\') it\\'s a terrible loss for the acting industry, what he really needs is a film like Kick Ass again: a blockbuster that actually shows his considerable talents :)\\n@Jeffo193 They don\\'t pay for mansions he can\\'t afford.\\nWhy is his major addiction to alcohol so subtle and hidden in this trailer? It plays a massive part in the film...\\nI love how the trailers change through time. If this was a trailer now, it would be considered appalling.\\nThis movie showed Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue at their very best. It\\'s about a codependent relationship between an alcoholic (Cage) hell bent on drinking himself to death and a prostitute (Shue) that attempts to give him unconditional love. This movie will break your heart and show you want really good acting is all about.\\nWorst trailer for a really great movie\\nFurther proof that Nicholas Cage is a considerably talented actor, whose number of bad choices in films vastly outnumbers his good ones\\nShue hasn\\'t aged well.....she used to be top class.\\nnick cage won the oscar for this role!\\n@Fanofcartoons1994\\n\\nAgreed. This movie was very serious and sad.\\nMost people who live in this city has a love/hate relationship with her.\\n@ingasa13 coz it wont come in 3D and theres no happy meal toys that\\'ll come with it.\\n@naklip It\\'s \"Lonely Teardrops\" the famous version was by Jackie Wilson, but this one is sung by Michael McDonald (that used to be a Doobie Bro. and sometimes sang for Steely Dan)\\n@PetroniusSatyricon69 Ha, I know! I loved this movie and knew then that I never wanted to see it again. Damn good actor.\\nThe best movie!!!!! Why  they cant make movies like that anymore?????\\n@tareyagreen Haha, I know right? This trailer makes the movie seem like it has some lovey-dovey happy ending\\n\\nyeah this story is horrible, desperate and sad, totally inappropriate music and narrator!\\n@Jeffo193  Totally agree. This movie shows the great potential of what Cage can do with good material, or wise versa.  Sad to see such a great actor waste his talent on movies like Drive Angry or The sorc Apprentice.\\nBut i guess that\\'s what happens when you bankrupt yourself, you\\'re forced to take whatever gets tossed in your way..  Beggars can\\'t be choosers.\\n\\nA real loss for the acting industry.\\n\\n@EGarrett01 And also, because some of the trailers i posted had more quality that the ones who were already on youtube.\\n@EGarrett01 I put \"hq\" to get more views, kind of stupid when i think about it now.

Is Iron Man yelling at Magnito?\\nBetween this and the Hopkins version of “Titus”. It’s hard to say what my favorite Shakespeare adaptation is. Both are great.\\nI like his wild boar.\\nHow many killings?\\nThis movie is a horrible presentation of a William Shakespeare play.\\nShakespeare died in 1616\\nand wrote a story of a king in 1483.\\nYET the costumes are 1940 fashion and the characters are driving in cars not invented until the 1900\\'s\\nMeanwhile, the vocals are not only spoken in Shakespeare\\'s horrid  stage-play style of poetry writing (I\\'ll never understand why people like that) BUT the vocals are not recorded well so inaudible most of the time ranging from mumbles to screetches.  Meanwhile, the background music is so loud its deafening.\\nIf the director was aiming for a modern theme on a story of ancient history, such as has been done with the fictional story of Romeo & Juliet (Leonardo DiCaprio), it doesn\\'t work here because this is actual history and shouldnt be \\'time altered\\'.\\nGreat cast of actors in a horrible movie.\\nThis looks fucking retarded.

They don\\'t make movies like this anymore . ( wow Maggie Smith looked old back then still in Downtown Abbey show she looks the same strange ?? )\\nWhat the fuck is this?\\nRichard the turd.\\nEveryone complains about spoilers in modern day trailers yet this one spoils a ton of the film lol.\\nthis looks epic. cannot believe that I did not see this.\\nActually, for a movie that good, the trailer is rather unpalatable and perhaps misleading...\\nFrank Underwood is based off of Richard\\nWhat the hell is this? I expected a 15th Century historical representation of Richard III. This looks like a mid-Twentieth Century iteration of the Shakespearean play, which by the way is not historically accurate, because of political considerations concerning the Tudor dynasty.\\nnever thought i\\'d see richard III as hitler..\\nAs it has never been told before? It\\'s a pretty old play. it\\'s been told exactly this way for centuries.\\nAnd Englands flag at the time was The three lions of England on a red backround and the fluer de lis of France against a blue backround on a qaurtred flag\\nThis is Richard III of England right who ruled in late medieval times and was not a Nazi and existed 450 years before Hitlers rise\\nGod bless us and to our family!!!\\nYour brain fu-ked. Your brain off. What is the culture? Nothing.\\nI really don\\'t know what to make of the film.\\xa0 Some of it is absolutely sublime -- the transposition to a totalitarian state is brilliant and conveys to the modern audience exactly how chilling Shakespeare meant the rise of Richard III to be, lying, cheating and murdering his way to the top, all the while managing to convince everyone -- from the women he seduces to the confederates he first wins to his cause and then betrays and has slaughtered when he has no further need of them -- that he is their ally.\\xa0\\xa0 Unlike so many \"modern\" versions of Shakespeare, it is completely on point.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they have certainly taken some liberties with the story.\\xa0 Richmond waking before the battle and saying he has enjoyed the sweetest sleep ever conveys the impression that this is because he has enjoyed some great sex beforehand (and is about to enjoy some more), rather than having had the ghosts of all of Richard\\'s victims wishing him success in his dreams, which is a pretty key point of Shakespeare\\'s version.\\xa0 And Queen Margaret\\'s oh-so-prophetic curse at the beginning of the play has been lost.\\n\\nStill, the gamble certainly pays off -- and once again (as he did with \"Macbeth\"), Sir Ian is absolutely perfect in the role.\\nI have only seen parts of this film but Ian McKellen gave a phenomenal performance as the controversial York king. One of these days I am going to watch this from start to finish. The cast is just GREAT!!!\\nach ihr briten , das böse am briten ist halt deutsch , gell . drum heissen sie auch haus windsor und nicht mehr haus hanover .\\nA fantastic adaption!\\nThe true monster is the length of the drama, making it as hard as possible to finish shortly before a test. That\\'s actually the real meaning of it. Also, Shakespeare is ennervating with his damn over-the-top passion. That\\'s fine in your leisure, but not necessarily in a serious context...\\nMagneto vs Iron Man\\nI didn\\'t know that Professor McGonnagall had a son called Gandalf.\\nGreat playwright. I still think Macbeth is a better villian lol XD\\nA blu-ray release would be nice...\\nGod, it\\'s like the narrator can\\'t decide if he\\'s doing an American or British accent.\\nI fucking love this film but this trailer is just so... urgh\\nThis movie made Richard III into one of my heroes. \\xa0It also has one of the greatest seduction scenes in all of film.\\nAbsolutely one of my all-time favourites. Saw it many times, still have to get the DVD. Superbly filmed, a brilliant cast, and the way they incorporated some of the landmark buildings in the story is really great. Ian McKellen is pure evil in this and boy, does he do a good job at being evil.\\nI love Laurence Olivier\\'s version but wow this looks cool!\\nwhat is the name of the song near the end\\n250904 599 22 0 95\\nRichard III - Ian McKellen - Original Trailer  by Film&Clips\\n\\n\"Richard III\" (Riccardo III).

It\\'s crude and horrorfying . But still a better movie ;D.\\nP.S. : Sorry for my English , Im Dutch, And only 12 Years so...\\nYes, do the math. You can, can\\'t you?\\nAnd why did he? Because she lured him so she could kill him. This was never about her defending herself.\\nBecause this movie is seeing the wolf through the villagers point of view, a monster, as opposed to a person who is mentally ill.\\n\\n\\ndo the math? how bout the fact that we conversed  for an hour and a bit, with your comments magically rising in likes. almost like you keep coming back.  the story isnt about hunting down anyone, the fact he comes after her at the end should signify that. the werewolf is the evil located in us all, thats why the person who becomes the werewolf generally doesn\\'t know they are a wolf. kiefer represents something totally different. werewolf movies are about coming together. this movie was not.\\n\\nIn 5 years about 170,000 people have watched this video. Do the math.\\nWhen I say werewolf stories, I don\\'t mean stories about werewolves, it\\'s a metaphor for stories were the moral is people should hunter down and kill the monsters they see.\\nYeah, a spiteful assault.\\nlol ya because in the last hour one person came read your comment and thumbed it up. whatever. werewolf movies arent a sub genre of revenge movies . they belong to a monster horrors, even more specific classical horror, along with the mummy and the swap thing. revenge: the action of inflicting hurt or harm on someone for a wrong suffered at their hands. keep thumbing your own comments up, it makes no difference to the fact that im right.\\nI don\\'t think people care that much about commenting on this video, that doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t read the comments. If you don\\'t want to believe this is my only account, then don\\'t, I don\\'t give a shit.\\nRevenge is not standing up for yourself (defending), it\\'s just spiteful assault.\\nYes, and a subgenre of that subgenre are what I call werewolf movies. The difference being the moral of the story advocating such an action.\\nlol considering the last comment beside ours was 2 weeks ago.....i dont think people care that much about our conversation, so yes stop thumbing comments up with other accounts. yes she was standing  up for herself and her family. not only did he make her daughter a victim, he made the whole family a victim. she lured him on to her property hardly a lynch mob. you ve never seen taken. there is a sub genre of movies dedicated to avenging the death of a child. Christ. good day. learn movies.\\nPredatory rape and murder, yes.\\nShe wasn\\'t standing up for herself, she was intent on revenge for her daughter, and to stop this wolf doing it again.\\nI\\'ve never seen Taken, but I doubt it\\'s as simplistic and unsubtle as this movie is.\\nYeah... I only have one YouTube account.\\nrape then murder rarely  happens? the moral of the story is to stand up for yourself. its not just about protecting the future generations, the main character needed to get her life back. the werewolf is far far too simplistic. the werewolf doesnt represent evil, it represents fear. another huge difference. if you notice, the towns folk dont seem to intent on getting the wolf as you put it either. by your logic any taken is a were wolf movie too. thumbing up your own comments?? pathetic.\\nYes, a very specific real life issue that almost never happens.\\nThe morale of this story is people should hunter down and kill the evil that exists in this world (the wolf), to protect the women and children. Now if that isn\\'t the old werewolf story, then I don\\'t know what is.\\nnot at all. first of all it addresses real life issues that are still, believe it or not, on going to this day. Sutherland\\'s character represents for the second time now, the evil that exists in this world, that is seemingly untouchable. the only reason the evil was stopped, was because sally field, the good guy, the audience if you will, stood up and did something. a werewolf story? not even close.\\nTwo stars because it\\'s essentially nothing more than a modern day werewolf story.\\nexcuse me, but if the cast and director are a list, the movie is a list. the movie was very realistic. it had elements of real life. the meetings the feeling of being hopeless, because the justice system is corrupt, who knew? the button pusher, im assuming you mean Sutherland, is the figure head for what we hate and what is destroying our society even to this day. he is the bad that never seems to get his, until the prey fights back. two stars simply because of a personal vendetta? pfff\\nGood movie. Watched it with my mom.\\nI loved this movie :D Kiefer was very convincing in this role\\nAlguém tem esse filme completo?\\n\\nEd Harris is such a girl in this movie! Sally Field is awesome in any movie!\\ndownload it, takes 3 mins!\\nIt´s me, or kiefer in Eye for an eye seems James Hetfield??\\nYou could probably order it on netflix, or buy it at Walmart or something.\\nIf I were Sally Fields\\'s character, Kiefer Sutherland\\'s character would never have even made it to the court room the FIRST time, only to get let off the hook by the \\'justice\\' system, let alone get let off the hook in court a SECOND time. I honestly would have nothing to lose and wouldn\\'t care if I went to prison. He wouldn\\'t have gotten a trial. There probably would have been a trial for me, but not for him. Fuck that.\\nA B movie that somehow won the lottery and got an A-movie cast and director. The  premise was interesting and the characters felt very realistic, but the movie didn\\'t, it didn\\'t fairly question it\\'s premise as much as dictate it. This blatant button-pusher plays upon our most primal emotions as well as the increasing disdain for the criminal justice system, it\\'s just a terribly crude and bias movie that operates as propaganda for capital punishment and vigilantism. 2 stars.\\nI just Want to know where i can find this movie\\nyes u work out in mcdonalds 5 days a week :)\\nI don\\'t even eat cheeseburgers that often, idiot. I don\\'t eat McDonald\\'s no more than once a month. AND I work out 5 days a week for an hour a day each. Moron.\\nalso im english bet u dont even no the difference between being british and being english lol .u dumb dumb\\nEsse filme é otimo\\n\\nNow I KNOW you\\'re a troll. Have some more fish and chips, Brit.\\nSure, you would, dumb Brit. Then I would take a baseball bat and crack your fucking head open and knock out your teeth (well, the teeth you Brits never brush anyway).\\nYou\\'re all the way in the U.K. What are you gonna do to me? And you don\\'t even know me. You have have NO idea what I\\'m capable of, you little bitch.\\nby the way dipshit i no ur comment  was not directed at me but reading comments  to see if it was a good film i see ur shit .\\nnow i no a guy gets killed  the end so as the film goes on and i see some one brake in a house im gona no the dude gets killed .so u are a troll .\\nWhat the hell are you talking about? I never said a single word to you. My comment is from a month ago, and it wasn\\'t even directed at you, you troll.\\nI love this movie, I have it on DVD. Many people dismiss it as a \"man-hating\" sappy Lifetime drama. I bed to differ; albeit a bit predictable at times, it is a constant edge-of-your-seat crime thriller. I myself am a criminal justice graduate heading on to pre-law education. This movie both confirmed and motivated my passion for criminal law and bringing offenders to justice in a professional, rigorous, and expedient manner. Excellent film, you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nAt the beginning of the movie when Sally runs into the younger daughter\\'s bedroom, you can see the camera guy\\'s reflection in the mirror. Whoopsie.\\nAt the end of the movie, when he broke in the house, I would have shot him right in his dick, and NOT killed him. Then I would have let the cops arrest him. Who knows? The system might let him off (yet AGAIN), but at least he won\\'t be using that thing to rape any girls anymore.\\nThis movie was very messed up, the part with her daughter getting killed was hard to watch.\\nforgive me for being sensitive to such a heinous crime. I\\'ll try and learn to laugh at girls and women being brutally raped.\\nWatch Mystic River for the flip side to vigilantism. Kingsnake, you are supposed to dislike the rapist, not like his lines.\\n\"She was a great ffffuck.\" favorite line from Kiefer.\\n@lkshaw1 i saw that last night too. you probably live in vegas.\\nThis movie came on late last night\\n@Fanofcartoons1994 what the-?\\nthis movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved it because for one thing it has sally fields in it and she has got to be the most amazing actresses in the world. Just the whole plot of this movie was awesome. I give it 5 stars .:D and 2 thumbs up. :DDDD <3\\nKiefer looks like James Hetfield (Metallica) in this movie.\\n@orlandobabe\\n\\n\\n\\nright!!!?? I\\'m a guy and I was fucking bawling I swear!\\nI like this movie for several reasons: two being the cast and the story-I like revenge or vigilante storylines, seeing Sally Field play a role like this was incredible, Kiefer S. was very convincing as a sadistic villian...again. When justice fails, then what do you do? I\\'m not advocating or condoning what Sally did for real life, but in a movie, it\\'s easier to condone it. I\\'m hoping the system wouldn\\'t fail this badly in real life.\\n@HermonieG1 He probbaly just headed butted them right back x) \"head on. Apply directly to the FOREHEAD!\" He must\\'ve been real scary in the movie.\\nI fucking love this movie.\\nwatching this movie made me cry lol :P\\ni coudn\\'t ever find Kiefer scary. he\\'s much too hot!\\nGreat idea for a movie and a great cast but i thought it was a terrible movie. For a movie that was released in the theater, it sure felt like I was watching Lifetime.  And to those begging for a Youtube upload, please just pay $7.99/mo for Netflix. It\\'s totally worth it!\\n@70sMiLA I saw the rape scene and I couldn\\'t watch it again, believe me it is hard to watch that without your stomach turning.\\nsuch a bad trailer for such a BRILLIANT MOVIE\\nkiefer is awesome\\nMan Kiefer was a damn good badass in this movie\\nI noticed a\"blooper\" or \"mistake\" in the movie, while I was watching it. For anyone who has seen it, you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about. In the very beginning, when Sally\\'s Character is doing her makeup, and then Ed\\'s character messes it up with the shaving foam, as the camera zooms in, you can see it in the makeup mirror.\\nJust thought I\\'d share it!\\nGreat film, a must see!\\nWHO KNOWS WHAT THE SONG IS CALLED WHEN KIEFER IS WATCHING TV AND IS DRUMMING ON HIS LEGS??? HELP!!\\nKiefer is awesome! Some parts of this are hard to watch to be honest but Kiefer just knocked the whole psycho rapist role out of the park\\nThe whole cast was amazing in this movie, but Kiefer turned in one of his best pre-24 performances.\\nAnyone please upload this movie........... i really want to see this because this is original.\\nI have seen remake of this movie in hindi. I loved that too...\\nOh God that murder scene in too horrifying..!  in both movies\\n\\nyou can see similar scene  from that movie here\\nyoutube.com/watch?v=ZrMWMs2Dxkg\\n@70sMiLA, \"Why hasn\\'t anyone uploaded this whole movie on youtube yet\"?? I\\'ve only been able to watch it once since it first came on because the scene with Kiefer Sutherland and Olivia Burnette is so horrific and much too graphic for me. The critics and viewers had a field day, saying the exact same thing, don\\'t know how in the world Olivia pulled that scene off. Everytime I think of it it really deeply saddens me, and fills me with anger even I can\\'t imagine.\\nawesome film i love watching it\\nThat rape murder scene still haunts me.\\n\\nIt\\'s similar to Enough.\\n@Sicksoullleee haha i saw this movie for the first time today and that was exactly what i was thinking!\\nWait why is it R\\nwhen i sow the trailer on tv for 1 sec i thought kiefer was james hetfield and i was about wtf?!?! :P\\n@15katevvet yea i know how that is\\nI saw the whole movie on youtube but that person took it off, who knows .. But I saw it for the first time on Lifetime , I\\'m warning ya .. that first scene is quite disturbing .. had an impact on me .. just creepy how you could be planning a party and the next your dead .. it was a good movie overall .. Sally Field was excellent .. Keifer was soo creepy , great job .  But it was a little hard to watch that scene , not gunna lie\\n@kornino I\\'ve heard that one many times before. But yes he does like him!\\nthis was an awesome movie. I was about the same age as the girl in the movie ( the victim) and the rape scene was graphically real even I was scared to be home alone for a while after that movie :(\\nIf this was a Dirty Harry movie, you could bet that Kiefer\\'s character would have had his creepy ass blown away by Clint...\\n@jebeja I accually saw this in theaters when this was out. The whole auditorium went dead silent after that scene.\\nHave only been able to watch this movie once, as the rape scenes are much too realistic and horrifying to watch (at least they were for me).\\n@SparksDrinker .....(o_o)....um no, I lack a certain thing in order to do that.\\nWhen Julie answers the door that\\'s not in the movie. Did they just do that for the trailer to disguise what was to follow in the actual film? The brutal rape.\\ni fill bad for that  17 year old she die she got killed buy a grown man she iz so so so scared when he was triyin to put it i9nbut i can tell thasz fake because cusz it showed her pantansz when he pulled her up to hisz dick that was so so so so fucken gross\\n@70sMiLA Because that would be illegal, spend a couple bucks like a normal person if you want to see it.\\nRapists and killers deserve no compassion, in my opinion. As for the revenge storyline, I like the genre, no matter how cliched it may get.\\n\\nThe movie is very well done, the cast, esp.\\n\\nI\\'m not an advocate for taking the law in your own hands, but if justice fails, then what do you do? I can\\'t condone failure of justice anymore than murder or rape. Plus I refuse to condemn what Sally Field does in the end, because justice did fail miserably, her and her daughter and I hope real justice works.\\nNext time you watch it, look in the little sister\\'s dresser mirror when Sally Field runs into her bedroom (first minute of the movie). You can see the cameraperson in it. Kinda wrecked it for me for awhile. But it was a good movie. The attack scenes were hard to watch though.\\nThis movie is ok but really inaccurate.  After the second woman he killed there wouldn\\'t be any doubt as to his guilt in real life.\\nNext time you watch it, keep your eye on the mirror in the little girl\\'s bedroom when Sally Field runs in there (opening minute of the film). You can see a crew member in a red shirt. Whoops!\\nSuch a great movie!!\\nit\\'s Shining road by Cranes :)\\nim looking for the song 2  :(\\noh please, can someone upload this movie?\\n\\ni never had the chance to watch it, but i heard it\\'s great:)\\nKiefer always had that fuckin\\' great voice?! Damn. Even when he was like 20.\\njust to let browneyednessagirl93 u can get this dvd in WH SMITH, for around £12\\nWhen Sutherland\\'s character says \"Ssssorry\" a long Sorry was he like making fun of her daughter because at the beginning she did stutter a bit, and Sutherland never did it after that.\\n\\nAlso Sally Field did seem to get over her daughter\\'s death a little quick I think it would have been a little better it they would have skipped ahead 2 months maybe.\\nTruly one of the best movies that Kiefer Sutherland ever did.\\n\\n\\n\\nKiefer rocks!!!\\nAny1 know where to find this movie??? I can\\'t find it newhere!\\nkief  is good plaing bad is so sexy he is a excelent actor*****\\ndude I just watched that movie and I fu***** hate that guy so much. I fealt so sorry for that girl in the beggining of the movie :(\\nDo you a longer version of the trailer from this movie?\\nseriously - it shows what an amazing actor he is, he\\'s sooo creepily believable!\\nI remember I saw this in theaters when it first came out, and wow, was it an assault on the senses. It is a very brilliantly done film though, and Olivia Burnette, who played Julie, shouldve gotten some sort of award for her short but still powerful role. But Keifer Sutherland really did a great job in the rotten, despicable role as Robert Doob.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, I will never watch this again. Thats how powerful it was.\\n220033 180 13 0 101\\nAn excellent movie!

But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher.\\n\\n\\n\\nA musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland\\'s true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path.\\n\\n\\n\\nRedefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don\\'t always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.\\n\\n\\n\\nGenres: Drama and Musical/Performing Arts\\n\\n\\n\\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 25 min.\\n\\n\\n\\nMPAA Rating: PG\\n\\n\\n\\nDistributors: Buena Vista Pictures Distribution\\n\\n\\n\\nProduction Co.: Hollywood Pictures, Radar Pictures, Charlie Mopic Company\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Box Office: $82,564,043\\n\\n\\n\\nFilming Locations: Portland, Oregon, USA\\n\\n\\n\\nProduced in: United States\\n\\n\\n\\nStarring: Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H.

(catchwords: irak, civilians, helicopter, america, bradley manning, hooray)..continue playing god. amen.\\n\\n@sophiascalpel those are on an entirely different moral wavelength.   this man poisoned people with no moral rationale or purpose - he was a sadist.   whether or not you believe in the death penalty (given to those assumed guilty by a law) or believe in war (a moral absolute that is unavoidable since the beginning of time) is irrelevant to the question of this man\\'s guilt.  get it yet?\\n@touchogrey well, i rather have sympathy for a killer than \"normal\" people idolize the army and killing thousands of innocent people or/and than a country that thinks death penalty is the way to justify.\\n@ceruleanee that\\'s awful.  this movie glorifies murderous and inhuman activities.  nothing good about imitations and those who cannot draw the line between fantasy and reality.\\n@MOBRIEN1234567 some of the music is in the movie, heh\\nMan, I love this.

I even like the lesser-known films she made---including the ones where she was made to be sexy, cause frankly, it\\'s lovely to look at and relates to the viewer\\'s own desires, so it\\'s nice  to see passion on the screen. Therefore, I don\\'t appreciate the way this documentary takes a critical tone with almost every movie she did, as though Jean was ashamed of them all. If she was, she shouldn\\'t have been.\\n\\nAnyway, I like that her movies are so sensual, offbeat, odd, beautiful, and varied. This documentary, while interesting to watch, was entirely too harsh in its critiques.\\nJean was a beast of a intellect. And perceptive in the extreme. A avatar of creative and spiritual courage in any and all times.\\nThank you. I love Jean Seberg.\\nExcellent honoring of one great overlooked actress.

Starring legendary funnyman John Candy, as well as Rhea Perlman, Alan Alda, Kevin Pollak, Rip Torn and Steven Wright, Canadian Bacon is one \"funny, acidic satire\" (Variety)! Faced with sagging approval ratings and disgruntled arms manufacturers, the U.S. President (Alda) decides to cook up a new Cold War with Canada! And after a flood ofmedia propaganda, Americans waste no time in \"patriotically\" burning their ice skates and swearing off maple syrup. But when bumbling U.S. sheriff Boomer (Candy) and his hair-trigger deputy Honey (Perlman) decide to take matters into their own hands and lead a preemptive strike, they soon find themselves embroiled in a hilarious international incident that\\'s too close for comfort, eh!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Canadian-Bacon-Alan-Alda/dp/B000059TG8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1239444325&sr=8-1\\nPT2M3S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::72\\n1:11/2:26  The destroyed Airplane from Jurassic Park III on ISLA SORNA.\\nbook was 10 million times better, but I love this campy piece of crap\\nWhat is the name of the song Dylan Walsh sings to Amy then the whole crew starts singing so she could go to sleep before they got on the river\\nYou know I remember seen summer movies in 1995 I seen Congo Mighty Morphin power rangers the movie Batman Forever Waterworld Judge dredd & Toy story!\\nSTOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!!!\\nThis movie was a huge pile of shit. Why the hell did the filmmakers feel the need to change so much of the novel? What a bunch of arrogant assholes to think they could tell the story better than Crichton.\\n\\nTim Curry\\'s accent was ridiculous, btw.\\nI thought Congo was okay. The book is way better. Right now I\\'m reading THE ICE GORILLA, an action adventure book similar to Congo in many ways.\\nThe Green Mile does a pretty good job\\nI remember the merchandising and publicity for this movie REALLY well. They were pushing it HARD but it never ignited the kind of interest Jurassic Park did. I was eight years old, but curiously, never asked my parents to take me to see it. As for \\'Jurassic Park\\', I was six when it came out & my parents thought it was way too scary so wouldn\\'t let me watch it. I finally saw it when I was eight or nine and LOVED it! \"Congo\" looks like a cheesy rip-off though...a bad adaptation of Crichton\\'s book.\\nIf reading means having good taste, then I must be a chef :-P\\n$50M budget but made $152M worldwide... the book fans can shut up.

Can you explain what are say.... 5 most significant changes between movie and the book?\\n@FreonRose In the book they make tools and weapons to kill intruders. they also come up with strategic ways to get around the electric fences into the peoples\\' camp\\nThere is a updated cover of Congo on DVD but I am not going to tell you where it is.\\nare those the same villagers chanting that were in the fall?\\n\\nthey look really familiar... hmmm...\\n@EddieWyatt1\\n\\nOMG me too!!!\\n@Draknfyre I know what they were trying to say but it comes off corny. That diamond was the size of a baseball she could have retired off that. What about all those people that just died, that money could have went to their families. But like I say, I like it, I can always watch it. I\\'m sure the book was very good but the movie was bad. Heres another thing that gets me, How is Ernie Hudson supposed to be a safari guy with that neat processed perm hairstyle. But he\\'s my fav character in the movie\\nI really like this horrible movie. Its just bad but I watch it at least once a year...and i know it sucks. The horrible Amy the Gorilla costume or the plot lines that make no sense. Like how come every plane in the movie gets shot down  but they get away in a hot air balloon. Or she throws away a huge diamond to spite her enemy when shoe could have took it to his competition and ran him out of business. but I love this movie none the less\\nthis is one amazing film!<3\\nXD i like how people are getting technical about this\\nThis movie was famous for being filmed mostly in the studio lot.

I enjoy good special effects, animatronic and CGI alike,  but it annoys me when film makers go over board.\\nTrailer still scares the shit out of me espeacily the loud sounds in the begining creepy\\nthis movie made twice its budget\\nfucking awesome movie\\nThis movie is a major disappointment for Crichton fans (a lot like the other adaptations of his books).  Worst part of the movie was the lava.  The book actually makes it a point to say the lava is not the real problem.  It moves too slow to be any danger to you.  The real danger is the smoke, ash, and debris.  But lava that chases you seemed more theatrically fun.\\nI think this movie was very underrated. 1995 was the year of my favorite movies - Copycat, The Net, Congo,  Braveheart, GoldenEye, Money Train, Dangerous Minds...\\nCongo is awesome movie!\\nAwful movie on most levels, yet, there is something about it I can\\'t help but like.\\nAgreed I said that too..it needs to be more intense\\nHow old is this movie?\\noh so that\\'s the name of the movie, this movie use to freak me out when I was a kid\\n\"I am your great, white guide....even though I happen to be black.\" one of my favorite lines.

The red sash & the nickel-plated revolvers made him stand out & intimidate the men around him, which is exactly what he wanted.\\nThe film was OK, as far as it went, but they were stretchin the storyline like a rubberband.

After teaching in a public school for twenty years, Crocker-Harris is being put out to pasture in a less stressful job teaching English to foreigners. Meanwhile, his home life is also falling apart: his wife (Greta Scacchi) is having an affair with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who nevertheless admires Crocker-Harris for his dignity and decency. Through it all, Crocker-Harris hides his pain behind his stiff British reserve.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Paramount (1994)\\nCast: Albert Finney, Ben Silverstone\\nDirector: Mike Figgis\\nProducers: Mimi Polk Gitlin, Ridley Scott, Olivia Stewart, Garth Thomas\\nScreenwriters: Terence Rattigan, Ronald Harwood\\n\\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

If one sees the original, it is not surprising that it had a big impact in Russia in it\\'s perceived\\xa0telling of the truth of the Russian revolution and its aftermath: that the \"White Russian (monarchist)\" element (including international links) was always there (hence, later, Stalin), and the \\'reds\\' (known to the world\\xa0mass-media as Marxist Soviets) were actually republicans that never truly won. What happens to the old \\'red\\' hero at the end of the film\\xa0reflects \"that\" as much as what the purges of the 1930s were really about. On a totally different level, Eric Rohmer\\'s Triple Agent tells a 1930s story about the old red-white conflict that is far less melodramatic but is perhaps more realistic by not focusing \"too much\" on the question of personal suffering as part of the political scapegoat process.\\nWhat a crock of shit when it comes to producing a trailer. \\'Burnt By The Sun\\' isn\\'t some kind of romantic pastoral film that eulogises the life and loves of a Russian soldier. It\\'s a Chekhovian domestic tragedy with at its heart the murderous political darkness of the Stalin era purges. Obviously whoever at Sony who decided to give this film a release into the American market either thought the prospective audience were idiots who couldn\\'t cope with complex themes, or needed to be blatantly lied to.\\nThis trailer makes it look much more feel good than it is...

It\\'s weekend and I\\'m drunk I just thought of browsing some movies that I saw when I was young, feels good man!\\nYeah, I agree. I wish she was in it a little more.\\n\\nYes, she is.\\nI know. Sometimes critics can stick it up their butts. This movie is awsome.\\nThis came out a couple of years after point break. And it wasn\\'t highly marketed and there weren\\'t as many theaters showing it. That\\'s why it didn\\'t make money. Poor marketing/advertising and not enough showings. Plus it came out around the same time as a lowdown dirty shame.\\nWesley Snipes was badass in this movie.\\nAdrenalin Ltd.\\n2 million dollars in money...what was there not enough potatoes?\\n@rprince418 PROVE IT,OR I WILL STICK YOUR HAND IN HOT BOILING WATER TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE.\\n@levelat350 I HAVE!!!!\\nYea it was a good one,\\nThey don\\'t make movies like this anymore. Nowadays every big movie is either a sequel/remake or about superheroes.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s quite ironic that this trailer didn\\'t feature the actual music from Drop Zone when it\\'s been used in about a hundred other movie trailers.\\n@grayeyezguy Heh, you should do some research yourself.  They did as much skydiving as they did surfing in Point Break.  Like I said they were adrenaline junkies, regardless of the sport.\\nNOBODY HAS SEEN DROP ZONE!!!\\nPHOENIX!!!!!!!!!!\\nDidn\\'t this come out the same time as Point Break.  I think they got creamed at the box office.  Point Break was the better movie for sure.  This movie portrayed sky divers as adrenaline junkies, while Point Break portrayed adrenaline junkies as skydivers.\\nI really liked the credits of this movie, you know where you see Yancy Butler\\'s silhouette flying through the air? I thought that was beautifully executed, haha.\\nI saw this movie when it was in the theater, and I thought it was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nSWOOOOOOOOP!\\nFreefly scenes are only thing making it bareable in todays standards.\\nyes it appeared in Canada, watched it many times.\\nI grew up on this movie, it was amazing, I loved it\\nNOSTALGIA RUSH\\nI watched this movie even before I was a skydiver, and I\\'m now a skydiver, and all I thought about it before has been confirmed: it is utter shit, garbage, puke, trash, crapola. But I want to watch it again for the skydive scenes. The ones with Snipes are blue-screened all the way (and laughable) but there are some freefly scenes that look fun.\\n\\nSnipes is an asshole, by the way. Tax evading piece of shit. What ever happened to \"redistribute the wealth\"?! I guess he\\'s no Obama fan.\\nsuper movie.Hello from Poland.\\nshe\\'s the bad girl. there\\'s good shots of her 13 seconds in and at 1:31.\\nlove this movie\\nClaire Stansfield was the reason why I loved this movie. She\\'s such a hottie!\\nNeed more Weslep Snipes.\\nGary Busey the best actor hello from POland\\nI\\'m surprised to realize that the main writer for High School Musical was involved with the Wesley Snipes action thriller, Drop Zone.\\nGary Busey!

The film tells the story of a retired and widowed Chinese master chef Chu (Si Hung Lung) and his family living in modern day Taipei, Taiwan. At the start of the film, he lives with his three attractive daughters, all of whom are unattached. As the film progresses, each of the daughters encounters new men in their lives. When these new relationships blossom, the stereotypes are broken and the living situation within the family changes.. The film features several scenes displaying the techniques and artistry of gourmet Chinese cooking. Since the family members have difficulty expressing their love for each other, the intricate preparation of banquet quality dishes for their Sunday dinners is the surrogate for their familial feelings.\\n\\nMGM - 1994\\nPT1M23S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::97\\n11326 22 1 0 0\\nThe Glass Shield (Trailer) 1994 / Ice Cube, Lori Petty, Michael Boatman & Elliott Gould (HD)\\n\\nDirected by: Charles Burnett\\nRelease dates: June 2, 1995\\nPT1M7S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::98\\nClassic and if you don\\'t think so.

It’s really awkward looking back at it. Even a classroom full of eight year olds found the editing shitty. I remember how kids in my class brought up how fake it looked when the dude fell down the hole. Oh well, this movie is meh. I don’t hate it but I don’t like it either.\\nThese 90s disney movies were awesome back in the day, and its so nostalgic when you hear that same damn narrator talk that talks in these trailers lol\\nOh what a great movie from my childhood.\\nThis trailer was seen on my VHS copy of The Big Green.\\nRemember when not everything was based on something?

I just didn\\'t care to see the sequel.\\nOne night, I just wanted to watch something awful, for some reason, so I saw one HBO channel was airing this film and gave it a look.\\n\\nTo say this is an awful film is an understatement.  It\\'s not even one of those \"so bad it\\'s good\" films, it\\'s just BAD.  The jokes are contrived, most of them consisting solely of modern references, it makes a MOCKERY of history to an unforgivable degree, and the special effects... I think nowadays an elementary school student could produce those.\\nFor years I forgot about this movie.\\nGeez, what a sellout movie, especially when the announcer makes an obvious plug of Thomas Ian Nicholas\\' early baseball movie \"Rookie of the Year.\" At least \"Rookie ...\" made more sense of a movie. It\\'s just a good example of how Disney attempts to cling onto Fox.\\nWhich is better? This or Unidentified Flying Oddballs?\\n\\'\\'Wherever videos are sold\\'\\' because they weren\\'t really too sure what it\\'s called\\nI don\\'t even like the narrator of this trailer ( that same voice that narrated thousands of Disney trailers,) that\\'s a faggot\\'s voice!\\nThis movie is garbage and it earned a 0% rating on rotten tomatoes along with Superbabies: baby genuisses 2 and Fred the movie. Most 90s Disney live action films were shit!\\nTo think the great Academy Award winning Kate Winslet was in it! ( Princess Sarah)\\nI used to watch this movie a lot when I was little and I\\'m only now learning that Kate Winslet and Daniel Craig were in this movie...\\nWhy do they call it Mad Dog bubblegum?

I don\\'t agree with all of it, but I do think that the Seal of sanctity of the Confessional is man made and allows evil to fester in the Church. And I think the Church needs to be more forgiving when gay priests break celibacy. Few priest have never fallen once, we are sexual beings it\\'s hard. When it is a straight priest there is always forgiveness but not for gay priests (of course the sexual abuse of children is completely different, and those priests must be prosecuted and incriminated).\\nA lot of people are so quick to pass judgement on LGBT people, saying it\\'s a choice, learned behavior and worst of all, sinful. Frankly, I don\\'t agree with any of these assumptions. Those who think it\\'s that simple, newsflash! It isn\\'t! This community suffers enough rejection and pain, those ideas are WAY OUT OF DATE! I\\'m so fed up with holy rollers who think they can judge this more harshly than everything else: Love is color and gender blind, get off your soapbox!\\nRIP Antonia Bird\\nthe ending gets me every time!!\\n\\nThe first time I saw this movie, I wasn\\'t sure what to expect, bc the case was so vague describing the plot. I liked both the gay priest and Father Matthew, but the subplot involving the sexual abuse, was not only good, but needed to ad to the conflict. No wonder the Catholic church didn\\'t like this movie, bc it exposed the dark side of their church, oh no! Their religion seems to thrive on secrecy and scandal, well, I say this movie was ahead of its time!\\ni just watch this movie, actually i didn\\'t give a shit about that gay priest i was more worried about the girl and the stupid confession that is a secret i think it is major stupid that confessions are a secret cuz people who are doing the most awful of things can just go sit have a nice chatter and walk away again without fear that the cops will be knocking on their doors within the hour, if the crime is heavy confession secret must be lifted and the person must be stopped.\\nmuy buena película sobre la vida clerical\\n\\nSuch a good movie.\\n118743 95 13 0 8\\n\\nPT1M56S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::113\\nNo wonder it got bad reviews.

(From 0:00 to 0:34) Thank you!\\nThis is the hottest on film Sharon Stone ever looked. Yes even more than Sliver or Basic Instinct.\\nlooks like great movie three great actors\\nI found this to be very enjoyable having recently watched it a second time. Great cast and setting. Good story line. Well paced with a good mix of action and dialogue. Stallone is badass. Sharon Stone hot. James Woods the ultimate scumbag. Eric Roberts excellent as usual... I don\\'t see why this film has seemingly dropped off the radar.\\nYES! So GOOD!\\nWhere\\'s LaFontaine\\'s \"October 7th?\" It was right after he said, \"Stallone, Stone....\" The screen goes red before the titles for the film. Classic trailer though! Thanks for posting.\\nThis was one of Stallones best movies it was pure class. Everything was done in a classy way even the shower scene between them. And the soundtrack was also great. I remember when it came out everyone wanted to see Sharon Stone in the shower.\\nPpl saying this was not good movie does not know a thing about movies at all..Sadly but thats a fact you haters\\nI give sly some props also. Even though he didnt act nearly enough. His character was to quiet. Should have had some more zing. Stallone can act. He has the potential to be great. He just isnt always. Who is. But i give him props because it was a different role for him. It wasn\\'t the typical bang bang role or movie. Like i said not a bad flick just not very good. Could of been like casino. Still very entertaining.\\nThis movie had all the potential to be great and i mean great. Dont get me wrong. Its not bad. Its entertaining. James woods is great. He alone makes it worth watching. Sharon stone did her thing. Also not a bad story. Nothing deep or great. Stallone did his thing also. The part where sly said to woods you got no code. Very good. But with that being said not good either. Poorly poorly directed. To many mistakes.\\nDhe amount of ritually-sickled hammers he had to polish in order to get where he is, dhough...\\nit wasn\\'t Eric Roberts who killed her parents but his father!\\nWow@Sharon\\'s legs when she sat down at 1:14 mark and crossed her legs. I wanna kiss her legs LOL. Sylvester and Eric Roberts were in the classic movie The Expendables that Sylvester directed. I love that movie and it\\'s the best Expendables. I got it on dvd. I also got The Specialist on dvd. James Woods is a good actor and I like him.\\nlook at them , they look sexy af #GoldenTimes #AgingSucks\\nAre we referring to the \"Bomb Specialist\", \"Dynamite Specialist\", \"Explosive Specialist\", \"Medical Specialist\" or \"Free-kick Specialist\" because due to my knowledge, being a specialist means that you are an expert in a certain field hence they cannot exist in so many different fields? I do not have the knowledge of so many different types of specialists around.\\nLove that song. What\\'s the name?\\nI heard that Slyvester Stallone left Sharon Stone breatheless in the showers after squashing her by pinning her down from on top just like in the film The Nutty Professor.\\nOne of the ultimate guilty pleasure movies. I\\'m a huge Stallone fan but James Woods stole this movie. It\\'s worth watching just for him.\\n@ John Jessop\\n\\nshit happens. something went wrong :D don\\'t worry, be happy ;)\\nGreat movie, only they didn\\'t show Sharon Stone slapping Rod Steiger in the movie at all\\nVery good movie and Sharon Stone was hot in this. I know Sylvester Stallone was happy to have sex with her LOL. I like the scene when she was talking to Eric Roberts at his house and she was sitting in the chair with her legs crossed and Eric walked over to her and kissed her leg. She has nice legs. I like the scene when Sylvester beat up those bad guys on the bus and he let that nice woman have a seat LOL.\\nWoods and Roberts should have switched roles, then it might have been believable.\\nStone was too old. How could Eric Roberts have killed her parents when they were clearly the same age?\\n351921 635 48 0 84\\nOriginal theatrical trailer for the 1994 film \"The Specialist.\"  Starring Sylvester Stallone Sharon Stone, James Woods, Eric Roberts, Rod Steiger.

He decides to murder Clay and take his identity, only Clay survives the assassination attempt with no memory and is mistaken for Vincent. The fact that Harris is white and Haysbert is black only complicates a film that probes into the nature of identity.\\n\\nAfter viewing an early rough cut, Steven Soderbergh came on board as executive producer and enthusiastic patron. Suture went on to become a hit on the festival circuit, including Sundance where it deservedly won the award for Best Cinematography.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ArrowFilmsVideo\\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ArrowVideo\\nFollows us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/arrowvideo\\nPT2M6S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::124\\nTenho esse filme na minha coleção.

Anyone know what year this movie was filmed?\\nTO LIVE ............. PERU !!!!!!!!!\\nIt seems to be a good movie.\\nMany years ago when i was a student in university I watched it and was hard to forget it because it\\'s too shocking.In china, it\\'s banned by chinese communist party government. In my opinion, it\\'s the very peak of chinese movie .\\nJust finished reading the book, and I literally sobbed I couldn\\'t breathe. Need sometime to watch the movie\\nMaybe \"To Die\" would be a more fitting tittle. It was a sad movie but it was a good movie nonetheless.\\nLittle bun, spoiler alert\\nmaybe best movie ever.\\nBanned for a time in China...\\n\\nBecause the CPC won\\'t admit Mao\\'s crimes\\ni didnt know that...O____________________O\\no my god, i cried like a baby during the hospital scene. I swear to god i dont think ive seen anything that sad before...i dont even think warhorse was that sad in my opinion\\nThis is the best movie ever.. found it suddenly back in Shanghai on a market stall after several years looking for it; made it even more special for me to find it in China that time. The movie is about real life and all that really matters. If you like the old China and pure movies, there is no better than this..\\nThis movie is so epic and touching, you\\'ll be breathless all the way through, saw this movie during a university lecture at WSU for world civilizations. Pure class.\\nBest Movie!!\\nsaw it in history class.\\nso touching!\\nThe characters were amazing; and I could not get to sleep .. I felt quite shaken by it .. but I watched it very late and went right to bed.  Amazing film.  I guess everyone here knows the director and Gong Li were basically put under house arrest for 2 years for this movie.\\n@quiden the trailer is not finished\\nMore people need to know about this film. Such an epic although it is quite a depressing story. It is the Forrest Gump of Chinese cineima due its presentation of china\\'s history in the film.\\nOne of the greatest films ever made, and definitely on my personal top 10. Starring two stars from another favorite of mine, \\'Farewell My Concubine\\'. I have seen \\'To Live\\' countless times and will watch it again and again. An amazing epic film.\\nSimply amazing film!!! Gong Li is a megastar. Zhang Yimou is a master film maker.\\nLove Gong li\\'s movies :)\\n@Meowsaidthekitty\\nIt\\'s not just good, this movie is amazing. Brace yourself for an emotional roller-coaster ride.\\nAbout half way through the movie, I just couldn\\'t take it anymore. I was emotionally connected with the characters. I cried like a little girl, and I\\'m a 28 year old guy.\\nThis movie is epic and brilliant. Definitely on my top 5.\\nGong Li is amazing\\nThese trailers tend to do that. The film is brilliant.\\nOh this is an OUTSTANDING picture.  The cast is amazing .. and it tells about the history of China since about 1940 .. how they did it in 2 hours is that they just show it though the eyes of this couple going through it.  Zhang Yimou, father was associated to the Nationalist side of the war (they lost), and as such he spend 10 years doing hard labour.  Almost Bizzare to us Westerners, people say it was very much like this movie. I loved it -- but very sad as you love the characters to much.\\nThis trailer looks awful, is the movie actually good?\\nI guess the regular \\'In a World\\' guy wasn\\'t available.\\nFortunately the movie is everything this cheesy western style trailer is not.\\n71769 111 3 0 34\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Live_(film)\\nPT1M46S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::128\\nThis was quite a movie!\\n5505 15 1 0 1\\nVillage Of The Damned Trailer 1995\\nDirector: John Carpenter\\nStarring: Christopher Reeve, Kirstie Alley, Linda Kozlowski, Mark Hamill, Michael Pare, Meredith Salenger\\n\\nOfficial Content From Universal Studios Home Entertainment\\n\\nTen emotionless children are born nine months after a small British town experiences a mysterious black out.

Her personal relationship with Hitler is still in question.\\n\\n\\n\\nFeisty and charismatic at 91, Riefenstahl revisits the landmarks of her turbulent life -- from her beginnings as a daredevil actress in German \"mountain films\" to her direction of such stunning narratives as The Blue Light (1932) and Tiefland (1940s, released in 1954), to her infamous, brilliant documentaries Triumph of the Will (1935) and Olympia (1938), to her anthropological photographs of the now extinct Nuba tribes in Africa. The film brings the story of Riefenstahl right up to her current passion, scuba diving and shooting films of exotic aquatic life. All together, a riveting story that leaves the viewer in total awe of its controversial subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical Acclaim:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A vital artistic event!

Jennifer Jason Leigh was horrible. I can only blame the directing, the most obviously acted movie I ever laid my eyes on, and the casting, since Jennifer Jason Leigh has not given a performance I liked, the least worst being Fast Times.

Didn\\'t go to a theater to see it.  I later rented the video but I couldn\\'t bear watching more than the first 20 minutes, Oscar-worthy performances or not.  A tedious melodrama and a disguised piece of anti-nuclear propaganda.\\nLOL, \\'talk to Jessica\\'!  Yeah, right.  Extras are a rung below the caterers. There is strict segregation.  The principals (main cast) are \\'royalty\\' and for very good and practical reasons. However, the PAs (production assistants) derisively referred to the nearby school where we were housed and prepped as \\'Extras World\\'. (But in \\'88 in \\'Mississippi Burning\\', things were more relaxed and, oddly, more professional. Hobnobbed with R.Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartaine and Mike Rooker.)\\nLike I said, one of the soldiers in that mess near the end of this trailer, somewhere on the right when Lange gets out of the car--too blurry to tell exactly where and dang near 20 years ago. Richardson actually gave me an unscripted line: \"Look out!\" (I was at the head of the column.) But that angle ended up on the cutting-room floor.\\nThis trailer is not able to show how good this movie is. okay the story is not really amazing but Jessica Lange is great and extremely powerful in her role! That character is in my opinion the best one she has ever played and she is so out-of-control , it\\'s unbelievable!\\nJessica Lange is stellar in this movie. Best Actress indeed. Of course, no one paid much attention to this film on account of Forrest Gump dominating 1994.\\nLOL... I\\'m in this... I was an extra, one of the soldiers Lange almost runs over in that parade. That was in June \\'91, outside Selma AL.

I have seen all his films except Green Card and Master and Commander.\\nBuzzy one: You\\'re in the 3% of posters who didn\\'t think this film was brilliant. Enough said - you sad, benighted twit.\\nit sounds crazy but too long and it didnt show hime do crazy ass things\\nIlluminati Movie...!!! ~K I L L U M I N A T I~\\ntjmady: Amen. My favorite film of all-time (and that\\'s saying something, cuz\\' I\\'m 53 and have been rabid filmfan since I was 10). Film, director, & actors got shafted by Academy. Peter Weir\\'s masterpiece, JB\\'s best performance of career (yes, imo, better than \"Crazy Heart\" and \"Lebowski\" roles), & Rosie, only one nominated, in her career-best role was sooo much more deserving than the other 4, who didn\\'t come close. A-way, one of the deepest films ever - agreed.\\nJeff Bridges is awesome!!!\\nman... i really want to watch this movie... and i could watch it for free on netflix, i wouldnt have to pay a cent... but  jeez idk... rosie perez?\\n1993\\'s Best Actor - Brilliant performance in a Brilliant film by Best Director, Peter Weir. BSA, Rosie Perez. Oh, and Best Picture!!!!!\\nOne of the most moving films I\\'ve ever seen. I literally burst into tears when the credits started to roll, which isn\\'t something I do often. I can\\'t recall any other movie that has made me feel this way...\\n\\nSoulcornflake1&Gildos2: Whoever & wherever u 2 are, u have excellent taste regarding brilliant films & performances. IMO, Academy purposely snubbed film because of Weir - not an \"in-crowder\". 93\\'s Best Picture, Director, Actor, & Best Supporting Actress!!! It\\'s ironic that film got one sole nom. & Rosie clearlly outshined other 4; the salt in wound is, they gave Oscar 2 a 12 yr old who sucked.\\nrbinfo: tad defnsve wen it comes 2 ths flm. 1)Hvn\\'t seen \"flwlss fim\" yet, be it cuz\\' of actng, s-play, dirctr, editng, mus\\'l scre, etc. 2) JB is my Fave actr of all-time. THIS prfrmnce is his BEST(inc L-Ski, CH) 2 date. 3)Ded rite re Acdmy! IMHO, 93\\'s B Pctre, B Drctr(btw, Weir\\'s Masterpiece, who ws jstfibly pissed off tht flm & crew were snubbed). 4)Rosie\\'s bst role evr-dzrvd Oscar. 2. Fearless in my Top 10 of All Time. Compelling look at loss/hartake & how love/cmpssn can soothe/hlp heal. 5\\nthe last minutes of this movie are fucking strongest I\\'ve ever seen in any film. just takes the breath.fuck!\\ni love jeff bridges!\\njust a dillusional idiot.\\nOne of my Top 10 favorites.

What better way to get ordinary film viewers to see this amazing movie?\\nWhat a ridiculous trailer for one of the darkest existential nightmares ever captured on celluloid!!!\\nOh fucking gaaa-aaa-aaads that is awful. The thick Spam voiceover crew were probably pushed on the schedule about five minutes before knocking-off time and did it back-to-back with the trailers for What About Bob and Uncle Buck. MAGGIE!\\nOne of the worst trailers ever.\\nThis trailer is terrible. The film is one of the best ever made...so brilliant, unique and David\\'s performance should\\'ve swept the Oscars that year (he was robbed). This trailer doesn\\'t show what the film is like at all...doesn\\'t even hint at it. If I didn\\'t know the film already, I would not be interested in seeing it based on this at all. What were they thinking? The fan made trailer out there by Chris Nightingale is perfect, they should pay him to use that one.\\nSaw it last night, he\\'s undoubtably the best character in the film, the rape scene is unreal\\ni havent seen this movie in like two years and i have only seen it one time at 3:00 in the morning...i want to watch it again sooo badly...David Thewlis is amazing in this movie...\\nI haven\\'t watched the movie yet (want to, though), but the music (by Rossini) is featured in \"A Clockwork Orange\", giving the impression that this film is also another one of those \"out-there\" satires. But that\\'s also a wrong impression, I suppose?\\nLove this movie. I iddentify myself deeply with the character.\\noh my godness. Naked - thank for sharing.\\n62278 74 10 0 25\\nwww.criterion.com/www.criteriondungeon.c om\\nPT1M26S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::195\\nand I just want 2 point out that 4 a movie that takes place n Boston they have the worst accents ever, they don\\'t even sound Boston n this movie\\nI always knew that after Buffy the vampire slayer that Hillary Swank would b a big star\\nok what the hell kind of trailer was that???!???\\n1. karate kid   2. karate kid lll 3. karate kid ll   4. the next karate kid and the film of 2010 was nothing i really didn\\'t like that one\\nThis one is the worst one. List for best: 1) Karate kid (1984) 2) Karate kid (2010) 3) Karate kid III 4) Karate kid II and worst is 5) The next karate kid\\nWorst f@ckin\\' movie ever made.\\ni have seen the original trilogy with daniel but never heard of this one, is it any good? or is it one of those films people try to forget existed?\\nMuch better than the 2010 Karate \"Kung Fu\"\\xa0Kid\\nthis is so cheeesy\\nWrong, the Jackie Chan one was shit compared to the other 4.\\nThis Movie is the reason of why she got her neck broken in million dollar baby\\nI think in the movie they said he went off to college or something.\\nBut what\\'s happened with Daniel?\\nnah ill stick with Ralph Macchio <3\\nI still remember, eventhough it\\'s nearly 14 or so years I saw this, the scene when she jumps on the hood of the car like that..always wanted to be that good with my reflexes. Did not remember Hilary Swank XD\\nYeah, same here. It wasn\\'t as good as the first three, but it had it\\'s moments. Plus... more Pat Morita is always a good thing.\\nI don\\'t know why people bash this film. I thought the film was pretty solid. Hillary looks beautiful\\nI wish i could see this movie\\nI only wish I could thumbs down your comment more.\\nyou are right. this movie is very good\\nwell actually Doug Walker was the Nostalgia Critic, you see his last episode was when he reviewed the movie \\'Scooby Doo\\' from 2002 and the show ended until to Boldly flee came out and then Doug Walker decided to make his character the Nostalgia Critic die like sacrifice himself i think and you know what i\\'m saying!\\nI can\\'t even begin to describe how awful this film is. One of the all time Hollywood lows.\\nthe Nostalgia Critic brought me here!\\nMaybe they should remake this with willow smith taking on the role.\\nGosh you guys...this movie wasn\\'t that bad. So what if it didn\\'t have the original guy in it? This is something different. I also like that they added some tracks from The Cranberries into this film.\\nFuck this movie I haven\\'t even seen it yet and don\\'t plan on doing so... It looks Fucking dumb and nothing compare to the old one ...cobra kai ..... Never dies ..fuck this bitch ill fuck her mouth ... Lol\\nhilary swank was fuckin beautiful in this movie\\nThis proves the 1980s didn\\'t truly die until 1994. This was its death cry.\\nEvery one who says that this movie sucks, PLEASE SUCK MY FUCKING COCK, this rocks...\\nid swank her\\noh dang this actually was a real movie\\n\\ni think Hillary Swank should take more roles as an action heroine specialized in martial arts, it\\'d suit her better, than what she accepts now...just saying...she\\'s still young, so why not...\\nYes that\\'s right.  The thing that happened was Miyagi walked into her room while she was changing clothes and she yelled at him that he should knock before entering where he apologized and told her the reason he walked in without knocking was because he said he lived with a friend named Daniel where Daniel walked into his room without knocking and Miyagi walked into Daniel\\'s room without knocking meaning he\\'s not used to knocking by force of habit.\\n\\nBy the way, her name is actually Julie.\\nTHERE IS AN ERROR IN THIS FILM, Miyagi tells JULIE THE KARATE TAUGHT YOU YOUR GRANDFATHER ... BUT IN KARATE KID 1 WHEN YOU ASK DANIEL Miyagi IF YOU EVER TAUGHT KARATE SOMEONE, NOT TELL THE\\nI remember seeing the coming attractions for this movie and thinking how gay this shit looked than again, I\\'m from the generation of the original Karate kid.\\nSince this film took place in Boston, I guess Daniel is back in California living alone, or living with his mom, or he went away to college.  (I do remember he told Mr. Miyagi that he is more important to him than college and getting a job so maybe Daniel decided to go to college now).  Hopefully, Daniel isn\\'t getting bullied by John Kreese, Terry Silver, and Mike Barnes.  Also, Daniel was mentioned one time on this fourth film by Mr. Miyagi.\\n@FailMaster13 That would have been great.  I do wonder whatever happened with Daniel whether he is back living with his mom or if he is getting bullied by John Kreese, Terry Silver, and Mike Barnes without Mr. Miyagi around.  It was at least nice that Daniel was mentioned one time on this movie.\\n@karatekidbandicoot I agree.  It would have been great.  It was nice that Daniel\\'s name was at least mentioned in this movie by Mr. Miyagi.\\nThis was garbage.\\nfor the people who hate this movie.  you have to at least liked the scene when mr. miyagi catches the arrow.\\nNow Thts Girl Power\\n@crossingXFY Yes, that would be awesome.\\nhe bang her in the ass at the end right?\\nDaniel should of been in this movie.\\nDaniel never fought as good as her.\\n@Slayter51 no, I watched it recently, and he does not.\\n@Slayter51 nope ):\\nKeep pressing 1 for Unlimited Punches,and 6 for Unlimited Combos.\\n@007Keanu 5 Karate Kids.3 of them had Ralph Macchio,This one is Hilary Swank,And the 2010 with Jaden Smith.The 3 of the Karate Kids with Ralph is the best.\\ni love this because of hilary\\nThis movie was crap but she looked freaking hot in a T & sweats\\n\\nhow \\'bout mr. miagi vs. jackie chan? uhuh? :D\\n@TaiXJ no\\n\\nim critising it because it was crap movie\\n\\nnot because the girl was the main character\\nim all for a girl being the main hero for a change but the movie was crap\\nworst one out of all of them\\nWHATS THE NAME OF THE SONG IN THE BEGINING OF THIS VIDEO????\\nWomen should work in kitchens? You should be ashamed with yourselves\\n- a guy\\nPiece of crap. Daniel san rules!!!\\nare their 3 karate kids?\\noh this is just suckish.\\n@Magnolia296 I have to agree... I loved this movie as a kid, maybe it\\'s because it was a girl i dunno, my bros think its cheesy...but everytime I brought it up, its like no one\\'s even heard of it lol\\nI really love this film and don\\'t understand why so many people hate it. Yes, I missed Daniel/Ralph but it gave a good feminine side to the story and Hilary Swank was brilliant. Pat Morita was impressive as always. The whole storyline was interesting. I still think that they should have made The Karate Kid 5 with Pat Morita, Hilary Swank and Ralph Macchio. It would be great.\\nThis movie is very very very underrated!!!\\n@kylephantom4 That would have been great since by now, Daniel is probably an expert fighter where he can help assist Mr. Miyagi to help the new karate kid get rid of her anger with karate.  I guess Daniel is probably back in California choosing to go to college (he said on the third one he needed a break from school) or, maybe he\\'s the owner of the banzai shop from the third film.  It was nice that Mr. Miyagi mentioned about Daniel one time on this movie to the new karate kid.\\n@coolestpersone123 He\\'s probably back in California either choosing to finally go to college (on the third film he said he needed a break from school) or, maybe he\\'s the new owner of the banzai shop that he worked in with Mr. Miyagi on the third film (without Mr. Miyagi around, I hope John Kreese, Terry Silver, and Mike Barnes are not bullying and fighting him).  It\\'s nice that Mr. Miyagi mentioned about Daniel LaRusso one time on this movie to the new karate kid named Julie.\\n@MrCoolaaa1 I have a feeling that Daniel LaRusso never went to college since on the second film when he asked if he can go with Mr. Miyagi to Okinawa, and Mr. Miyagi said he should save his money for college and Daniel told him that he\\'s more important to him than college and getting a job.  Also on the third film, he said that he\\'s not going to college to get a break from school, so instead, he worked in the banzai shop with Mr. Miyagi.  So my guess is that Daniel is the new owner of the shop.\\n@BLaCGaMiNG Well aren\\'t you stuck in another time if you really believe that maybe you shoudl see something with Cynthia Rothrock\\nIm a girl myself...and i prefer having a guy be the next karate kid just because it was that way in the original and in this version its a bit cheasy\\nMan did trailers use to suck!\\nthe fucking 90s ...\\nthat movie is sucks men,anyone have Paper Bag Please........\\nWhat a shity movie. The ending sucked, the story line sucked. Everything sucked. I cant believe Pat Morita agreed to be on this film.\\n@TheSteelersrock1010 ok i change it they mad one that has nothing to do with karate instead\\nI liked this movie cuz it shows girls can b just as tough as guys and I luv Hilary swank and took karate as a little girl. I\\'m only 13!!\\n@marioxnaruto he didn\\'t want 2 sign for the movie =(\\nwow this movie sucked\\n@CADalex I\\'ll take the 2nd over the first\\nWow. With Hilary Swank. Never knew.\\nyah the trilogy is wwwwwwaayyyyy better\\n@LoboFan1000 exactly\\n@LoboFan1000 miyagi wouldn\\'t ask her to do that, shes a girl, she\\'ll be asked to make sandwiches\\n@hotmoney3224 there is none.\"Mr.Miyagi\" died in 2005 at age 73\\nHilary Swank is.. The Next  Karate Kid :)\\nRofl this was the worst movie ever, i remember watching it like 10 times when i was a kid.\\n\\nOH THE 90\\'s..................\\n@shikamaruisfit\\n\\nKarate was originally built from Kung Fu.\\nI love this one because it has the girl as the star, a lot of karate and action movies don\\'t have girls in the spotlights. This shows that girls are just as cool as guys!!!\\nGo Girls!!:)))))\\nI actually like this movie... :) And also the 4 others... Just to put in a different oppinion here... :)\\nIf Hilary went naked in this movie we would forget how crappy it really was.\\n@LoboFan1000 HAHA! That comment is EPIC!\\nWho the hell gave that dude her own movie?\\nI definitely related to this movie more than the other ones, I liked it a lot. It captured the 90s fer sure.\\nthe other one should be called the black karate kid\\n@shikamaruisfit Karate means empty hand. Self defence without wepons.. it was developed based on old traditional chinese and japanese arts including things like kenpo and kung fu, which in itself is a collection of other martial arts.\\n@razzp25 i said that with a question mark meaning im asking the guy if they are not better than the first movies. I do believe T2 killz T1 because of its action packed scenes and powerful ending. it was T3 that screwed it up.\\n@sly741x are u kidding me??

How is that so when reviews are only opinions by a career based off opinions? Some loved it. I didn\\'t see it. If children loved it, because as a kid, we will laugh at anything really, and it was a very clean film. Then it was worth making, acting in and appreciating.

If North jumped off a bridge, would you expect me to do that, too? I\\'m getting sick and tired of you expecting me to live up to the standards you have set to me based on some stupid little goody two-shoes fart-sniffer! And the grounding for however long you see fit to force me to undergo for speaking my mind is well worth telling you that little bastard is not God, and I won\\'t be living by his standards!

If you need me, I\\'ll be waiting in my room for the inevitable roll \\'em down and 20 lashes with the belt!\"\\nI saw this movie, at the movie theater. It was okay. I only saw it, cause Elijah Wood was in it. If, it was a different boy actor. I probably wouldn\\'t seen it.\\nI\\'m getting this on DVD.\\nNot only is this film vastly underappreciated (by Ebert and others), it is the greatest movie of ALL TIME. I\\'m not kidding.

It maybe had a required taste of humor. But ive seen way worse movies that had this type of comedy, and none of them are hated like this. <in fact many of those shitier movies are even liked. Wtf. Is it because of some famous guy giving it a bad review? Seriously can you people not have your own opinions. I want to know what specifically was bothering you guys.

If you\\'ve never seen \"North\" then you aren\\'t missing anything.\\nBefore Movie 43 existed, this is the most notorious film ever made.\\nThis is why I hate the 90\\'s.\\nI know this movie was awful, but I quite enjoy it.

In this genre the lack of credibility can be made up for by a final plot twist, which is what the viewer will wait for.\\nUnfortunately it never arrives, the story just goes as follows. Will Smith learns to act posh and respectable while supposedly being the opposite, then he gets kicked out of a posh house, but wait.........no thats it.\\n3 degrees away from Lionel Messi.

It was my sister’s movie but i watched it a couple of times. I loved it\\nCharlotte Gainesbourg is so beautiful. She has that ethereal, pixie-like quality to her face and voice that Mr. Rochester describes.\\nJust watched this version, fell in love with William Hurt, and Charlotte..my favorite one by far_\\nI watched the Michael Fassbender version years ago and thought I didn\\'t like the story. But I just watched this and adored this version.\\nI have seen all the Jane Eyre movies, and this is my very favorite!\\nThe American accented narration for this trailer just doesn\\'t do it. Sorry.\\nMy favorite Jane Eyre!\\nThis is the first version I ever saw I love it\\nThis movie has bar the most anticlimactic first meeting scene XD It\\'s the Victorian era equivalent of a guy getting distracting by a hit chick and driving off the road by mistake :P\\nHard to watch this movie after watching the 2006 BBC one\\nFavorite version. Doesn\\'t get any better than this!\\nThis was the first version I watched :,) I was so sad at the time and this was perfect for my situation\\nThis trailer horribly reflects the movie! I\\'ve seen them all, and this is by far my favorite, if only for the perfection that is Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane Eyre. I swear. No one has ever so well captured how I picture Jane Eyre as Charlotte did. Incredible. Just wish this version was as long and in depth as the BBC mini-series, which I also love for its length. lol\\nloved this one, 2006 and 2011\\nHands down the best Jane Eyre.\\nThis is my favorite Jane Eyre of all time!\\nTHIS MOVIE LOOKS SO DISSAPOINTING!!!!!!! 2011 film is so much better!

Am I right?\\nThat was so bad. What I had just watched there?\\nKachoong 5.10c free solo by Stefan Glowacz at 55:56\\nDid the acrobatic climber make it to the summit at the beginning? The end of the movie shows the climber that died made it.\\nHas no one put that together yet? David Lama? The climbing gym pro going for a solo assault ,after his climbing partner dying in the first summit claim? Going on tv after all the skeptics said he didn\\'t do it, and promising to do it again, then using a power drill? It\\'s friggin the David Lama, and Maestri story wrapped into one character. But how did Hertzog know Lamas future with this mountain\\nThis movie sort of predicted the future, and then mixed it in with the past, and it wasgenious!! Future part I mean David Lama the sport climber kid who said he would free solo the route, and past being Maestri and his infamous compressor and the murder of the Cerr Torre. If I\\'m a moron, and that\\'s what they are going for, does that mean they predicted David Lama and the whole snow balls chance In Hell? Or did that somehow happen before1991, and I\\'ve been in a bubble ?\\nThis was a great bad movie! Achtung baby!!\\nGood mountain climbing drama. Good acting by \"Lifeforce\" actress Mathilda May, and supportive acting by screen legend Donald Sutherland. I still didn\\'t understand why the main character decided to climb the mountain at the end.\\n1:04:47 ich liebe die szene ;)\\nQuite possibly THE single worst mountaineering movie ever made, and one of the worst movies as such.

Angus is funny, rowdy and triumphant, a totally cool movie with a dead-on eye and ear for the hilarious, heartbreaking rite of passage called high school. A great cast (including Academy Award® winners* George C. Scott and Kathy Bates as Anguss oddball family) sparks this story about what happens when Angus is named King of the Winter Ball as a prank  and how he turns humiliation into victory. Angus, Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, delivers a rousing up yours to all the snotty high school golden boys [and] a climax that I, for one, found wholly the equal of anything in Rocky.\\nPT2M8S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::276\\nLynn Carlin’s laughter is real. She had trouble getting the level of uncontrollable laughter Cassavetes wanted, so in the final takes he had her deliver the scene while he tickled her leg under the table. It’s just one example of Cassavetes genius with directing performers and constructing the emotional core of a scene. (Source: studied his work with Ray Carney).\\nHer laughing is ridiculous\\nWhatever else this had, I didn\\'t detect any \"wit.\"\\xa0 This might have seemed cutting edge in 1968, but now it\\'s just childish to laugh embarrasedly over a sexual reference.\\nI saw \"Faces\" in Austin at the SxSW film festival. I think he mortgaged his house to make the film. Weather or not you like it that is total commitment to a film. Let the criticisms fly but what have you done???\\nI think this is the best film Cassevetes made.\\n\\nIt has a neat structure to it sort of like Antonioni\\'s La Notte, and the marriage unravels as dusk approaches.\\n\\nVery nicely acted, by actors who really are not known as first rank.  But he knew how to wrk with them, to get more out of them than they really had.\\n\\nFormally, no Cassavetes film is going to be great to look at.  But this was probably one of his better early films in that regard.\\n@chief3000 Either Way She\\'s Better Than Natalie Portman\\n@qwisp :: Lynn Carlin is the actress, and this was her first acting role.  this scene may not illustrate how strong her performance was for a first timer, but every scene between her and Seymour Cassel is gold, regardless of acting skill or experience.  her overdose is mastercraft acting.\\n\"Master of improv??\"  Lynn is fabulous and true in this film.  (what\\'s with this guy?)\\n@14842 \"Wicket\"?\\n@qwisp Lynn Carlin was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for this performance. She is excellent in the final 30 minutes. I suggest you watch the entire film. It is streaming on Netflix. And, \"Cassavetes\" only contains the letter \"t\" once.\\nthe first time in a American film cunnilingus is mentioned\\nIt\\'s the actress that lowers the quality of this scene. You have to be a master of improv\\' to be in a Cassavettes movie, and this woman ain\\'t. Then again, we can\\'t all be Gena Rowlands.\\n@BipolarPics  it took like 3 years to complete the film, maybe he was editing it while doing rosemarys baby.\\nWas he making this film at the same time he shooting Rosemary\\'s Baby? 1968\\nI agree cerzule.  The later scenes of her overdose and subsequent \"coming to\" are positively riveting, leaving the viewer emotionally and physically spent.  Kudos to her and Seymour Cassel for their amazing work .\\nOh yes, I love Lynn Carlin in this movie!  Her performance is astounding, especially considering that she had no prior acting experience.  This film is one of Cassavetes\\' best (I personally think it\\'s one of the greatest American films ever made), and, as bleak and painful as the movie is overall, this little clip is truly hilarious.\\nLove this film.  The actress here, Lynn Carlin, is an absolute genius with this scene...totally believable....and earned an Oscar nomination for her work in this film.  This is an early scene in a very unconventional film, definitely not for all tastes. Many later scenes tend to go on long after they\\'ve made their point ...but that\\'s part of overall theme.  Excellent performances.  The film\\'s working title could have easily been \"The Tragically Un-hip\".  Thanks for posting!\\nThat old man...is that the same actor who played Jack Woltz (the arrogant movie producer who finds his horse\\'s bloody head in his bed) from \"The Godfather\"?\\nActually I think one sees Cassavetes comic genius after being terribly alienated the first time(s).\\nit\\'s really quite pointless to watch this clip if you\\'ve never seen the film.  if that be the case, do yourself a huge favor and just go rent this movie.. cassavetes is the father of independent film making and this is a fucking masterpiece\\nya he is having an affair.\\nbut that alienation is perhaps what Cassavetes intended? i mean this is about a suburban couple who become estranged from eachother. I relate because i grew up in this sort of lifestyle where people end up discussing the most mundane topics...i saw this movie a long time ago. which is your favorite one?\\nlol well they think it\\'s funny... Though I do suppose they have pretty good rapport with each other-- however, in this scene I felt rather alienated, as though I were being left out on the joke.  This is uncommon for me when I\\'m watching Cassavetes\\' films, as I am usually quite emotionally engaged in what\\'s happening.  As \"savagedudeguy\" mentioned, it\\'s (usually) penetrating but the cause is intangible. I do agree with you, though, that it is not in fact a comedy.\\nits not suppose to be funny hot dawg...perhaps funny in an odd way???\\nits not a comedy playa\\nThis wasn\\'t that funny :(\\nSo amazing. It\\'s easy to say \"oh, hey realistic\" but there\\'s something that is just so emotionally penetrating. Blah, it\\'s definitely intangible.

In the bathroom scene La Beaumont seems to refer to that outcome as an unintended consequence, not as something she had planned. It seems to me that she initiated her flirtation out of willfullness, but I\\'m still not sure how she thought it would benefit her. When she initially goes to give the Major the flower, she first looks at La Bentley as if to say, \"This\\'ll teach her.\"\\n@dseanmat = Hi, to answer your questions: Question 1) My answer: Yes, she had an affair. Out of character? Not really. You\\'re shocked bcs you put expectations on her without knowing her. Sounds like it was convenient for Ms. Bentley to have that relationship since she was caring for her father. But that\\'s only a guess. Could be she never found the right one, until now. ... Question 2) My answer: For Miss Bentley. Ms. Beaumont mentioned this in the bathroom scene towards the end.\\n@voxgir: Having watched this film again just last night, I concur that it grows more and more enjoyable with each passing year. And yes, it does make one want to visit Lake Como! I just have two questions about the film which I hope someone can answer.\\n\\n1. At one point Miss Bentley seems to admit to the major that she carried on an affair with a married man for 14 years. This seems very out of character. Am I right?\\n\\n2. Just why did Miss Beaumont commence her initial flirtation with the major?\\nI like this movie so much I bought it. It\\'s one of those movies that you can watch again and again.

Like Gunga Din, Captains Courageous and The Man Who Would Be King, Kim belongs to the treasury of films based on Rudyard Kipling\\'s works. Dean Stockwell, then just five years into a career stretching from the 1940s into the 21st century, plays the title role.

Valerie seemed to really hate men. A lot of that due to her mental illness and paranoid schizophrenia. She was very smart, but suffered a lot mentally. She had a rough life. Lived poorly, homeless and as a prostitute for much of her life. Alone for most of her later life. Valerie\\'s is a sad story. Her SCUM Manifesto is her treatise on men and women. I wonder if you could show Valerie her whole life in advance and ask her if she wanted to do it all over again, would she want to do it the same ? I think not. As for Andy Warhol ? Talentless Overrated media hack. Andy showed that anything can be art.

The farm is wroked by Sarah Anders, whose husband is away fighting for the Confederate Army. Far from the great armies and battlefields, a very private civil war erupts. The Captain and Sarah are pulled apart by the war\\'s undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. Each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. This story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. Armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. Good people can be driven to do bad things. The story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. Based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the Civil War.\\n\\nMPAA Rating: PG-13 for brief violence and sexual references.\\n\\nCast: Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson is available on DVD\\nPT1M39S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::315\\nThe effects to that movie still hold up well.

Most of his friends, however, have graduated to the instant financial gratification of petty drug dealing. Hank yearns to escape his neighborhood and spends his entire savings on lottery tickets hoping to win the $27 Million Dollar Jackpot. His dad, Milt, doesn\\'t set much of an example--working a brain-numbing job at the phone company and soothing the ache of a ruined marriage and a dead-end career as a musician with his constant companion--a bottle of whiskey. Hank seeks his comfort through Joy, his Latina girlfriend, who has her eyes set on the future. As their romance grows--another begins. Hank\\'s father and Florence, Joy\\'s adoptive mother, struggle to deal with their rapidly changing children. In doing so, they find themselves seeing each other in new ways.

Dingo stars Colin Friels as John \"Dingo\" Anderson, a part-time musician and dingo trapper living in the bush who, after seeing his hero, legendary trumpeter Billy Cross (Miles Davis) on tour, longs to travel to Paris and play with the finest American jazz musicians.

That idea came from a novel written in the 1950s, \"Top of the World \" by Hans Ruesch. It became a film and that made it \"true,\" I guess! LOL. The mummified 111 year-old man was discovered when authorities showed up to wish him happy birthday. Oops!\\n\\nYes, I\\'m fascinated by Japanese history/culture, from Hokusai to Tora-San. I have the same birthday as Toshiro Mifune and saw him in a parade - in San Francisco!\\n\\nIt\\'s a cautionary folklore thing, actually. I tried to research the practice - called Ubasute - a few years ago and didn\\'t come up with much. It\\'s probably a story to make Japanese children respect their elderly who, in theory, are honored. If I were elderly, this story would scare the crap out of me, especially after a 2010 scandal; hundreds of centenarians turned out to be missing. An 111 year-old man turned out to\\'ve been dead for 30 years, his remains mummified, his pension still being used.\\ngreat picture!\\nIt\\'s about sacrifice.\\n120078 172 16 0 14\\nAvailable on DVD via Umbrella Entertainment: www.umbrellaent.com.au/coming-soon/4171-ballad-of-narayama-the-world-classics-collection.html\\n\\nFrom two-time Palme d\\'Or-winning director Shohei Imamura comes an unforgettable human drama and a milestone in Japanese Cinema.

Old Orin (Sumiko Sakamoto) has her family\\'s affairs to take care of before she too must go.

It is an arresting image. \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" may actually be one of those rare cases where the movie is better than the book, and the book is quite good. From 1968-70, the novel was re-adapted as a sitcom by the same name starring Hope Lange, Edward Mulhare, and Charles Nelson Reilly (as somewhat overdone comic relief). The sitcom ran for one season on NBC and then for a second season on ABC, and I think it worked relatively well in that format, though the book and movie are obviously better.\\nI think Captain Gregg set out the rules of his haunting, if briefly. Since he no longer had a body he could \"manifest\" himself visibly or audibly to anyone he wished. If he hadn\\'t left Gull Cottage since his death it was because he saw no need to and probably he stayed to protect the house against \"fools .  . and sea lawyers.\"  I think it\\'s his isolation, which he won\\'t admit to anyone, that draws Lucy Muir to the house.\\nDo you know how Joe Mankiewicz got the effect of Captain Gregg appearing to Mrs. Muir in a corner of the kitchen?\\nGene Tierney is excellent following the huge successes of Laura, Leave Her To Heaven and The Razor\\'s Edge.

I don\\'t call it a remake of the 1954 film because my understanding is that it will be a two film project that recreates the entire novel. The movie leaves out important characters and most importantly barely touches on the character who is a murderous demon in the novel.\\n\"East of Eden\" has long been one of my favorite movies of all time!

Uh oh. ;)\\nTbh, after seeing this trailer I don\\'t think I will bother watching the movie, it doesn\\'t look as though it does the book justice.

RIP jimmy, you\\'re forever missed.\\nreading the book now, planning to see the movie when I\\'m finished\\nJames Dean the best.. Haaa I got to see this movie, It looks so Awesome ... James Dean & Marlon Brando were the only men who got few of our fashion we got today lol\\nWay better than rebel without a cause , the title is so misleading , rebel? JIm is a lonley shy bullied guy with no friends and has family issues not really a rebel without a cause at all .\\nLove East of Eden with James Dean and rest of cast. \\xa0In my opinion, East of Eden is James Dean\\'s best of the three movies he made. \\xa0What makes Dean so great is the raw emotion that he shows. \\xa0That only other actor that is able to show this raw emotion as good or better is Brando. \\xa0James Dean died too young.\\nIs East of Eden a film noir or not?\\nPerfection\\nThe movie is great, James Dean beautiful. I gotta read the book.\\nSuch untamed emotions.\\nThis movie, affected me.\\nBut without Lee how can the book\\'s message be conveyed?\\nThe movie is mostly about the second half of the book.  It actually makes the movie a lot stronger.\\nI just finished reading the book and maybe that\\'s why I\\'m a little disappointed after watching the trailer for this movie ... where\\'s Adam, Lee, Sam?\\na little late but RIP Julie Harris!\\nYou didn\\'t have fast cars, microwaves, computers, televisions, and Youtube then...You DID have racism, fascism, The Great Depression, and The Cold War to look forward to...\\nLike any other movie base on a book the book is WAY better the movie. The movie only concentrate only on the second half of the novel, in which leads to many plotholes. And yes, I do recommend it for twelve-year-olds.\\nHave you read the book?\\nIs my favourite book! :D\\nomg the book this, this book THIS FUCKING AMAZING BOOK\\nI only watch 20 minutes of this movie. It focuses too much on Cal and Aron - and Abra. It is just all wrong in some way\\nDo you know.....anything about acting at all?\\nWhat\\'s all this talk about the fucking book, who cares if it\\'s not the same, doesn\\'t change the fact that this movie is fucking awesome. COME ON James Dean was a phenomenal actor.\\nThe feeling of not being love is one of the worst feeling ever, obviously you haven\\'t lived through that.\\nI am always amazed by John Steinbeck he was such an amazing novelist and East of Eden, in my opinion, is his best work simply because of CATHY . I am drawn to evil people and antagonists and I was so amazed how well he wrote evil. Cathy is not a clichéd villain at all--she doesn\\'t do evil for revenge or because of her childhood. She does it because it is simply her nature. Sadly, the movie only depicts Cathy when she became Kate, and not as a young, cruel woman but it is still a great film! :)\\nMany years too late to rant but: this is not how the book goes!! Ugh! lol\\nNo, they just used an alternate take in the movie.\\n2:01 they cut out this scene :O\\nIch weiß nicht wie oft ich den Film schon gesehen habe ?\\nAber ein zeitloser Filmklassiker !\\nCan you imagine teenage girls fangirling over James Dean back than? lol\\nI love the book. It was long but well worth the time spent.\\n2:12    Dat smolder.\\nIt is my favorite book. The movie wasn\\'t that good. It was a long book though. perhaps a Mini series? Abra was cast bad. I think Amanda Bines (when sober) would make a great Abra.\\n\\nThanks! I actually just started reading it and it\\'s amazing! A little depressing but great. I looked at some the reviews and asked my friends to read it too. Everything was possitive from them!\\nIt is a work of art by one of America\\'s greatest novelists, certainly better than any of the popular culture and tv shows or movies available today.  Read it at the library.  It is moving, brilliant and in my humble opinion more than acceptable for a twelve year old if you have the intellectual capacity to understand the writing, no reason you shouldn\\'t read it...\\nDoes the movie have the same plot as the book? Also, could someone tell me if they think the book would be appropriate for twelve year olds! My mother won\\'t let me read it cause she doesn\\'t think it\\'s appropriate! OVER PROTECTIVE MOTHER ALERT!!!!\\nI love the book and I love the movie. They have their differences but they\\'re both great :)\\nIf you can\\'t find the opening scene close by(if it\\'s still posted) pull up google and type \"uploads by bdyglv\" it will be for 3:02. Jo Van Fleet and James Dean, two emotional powerhouses indeed, with the sinister music of Leonard Rosenman..within 3 minutes..you are hooked!!!\\nIf your fortunate enough to find the dvd \"Viva Zapata\"-1952 Bk&Wt  with Marlon Brando,Jean Peters and Anthony Quinn-watch how Kazan crafts his characters and builds depth, bonding his audience with Zapata,Mexico and the dangerous treachery in higher government.\\nElia Kazan had the talent available in every character and used it wisely. The opening scene with Jo Van Fleet walking in town,a brooding musical undertone by composer Leonard Rosenman in sync with the first shot of James Dean and pure acting from everyone. High tension levels and inner conflict (Kazan\\'s forte) will work overtime on your emotions.\\nJust finished the book, wow. Haven\\'t seen the film, is Lee actually in it ?\\nI think I have a new favorite film director. East of Eden, A streetcar named Desire, On the Waterfront, all directed by Elia Kazan.\\nWow what I wouldn\\'t give to go back in time. James Dean <3\\nNow you will  be dead :DDDD\\nLOL You can all keep bitching about the inaccuracies in this movie, or you can pretend this has nothing to do with the book and just fucking enjoy the film! Doesn\\'t matter if they changed anything or not, this movie is still beautiful none-the-less.\\nThe movie is really good and yeah, it focuses on the love story but not THAT much (if you ask me) and I really think you should go and see that movie!\\nJames Dean was too beautiful for this world...\\nevery character here is so out of character, its disgusting!!\\nLeaps from the pages... *James leaps*\\nJames Dean is the worst actor I\\'ve ever seen. \"Rebel without a Cause\" was absolutely atrocious.\\nWhy focus on Cal and Aron? I would rather see more focus on the first half of the novel instead of the end.\\nohh 1955 beef, i love it :) xx\\nI just finished reading the book and I absolutely loved it. the movie is good but of course the book is better. Aron, Cal and Abra weren\\'t really a huge part of the book until towards the end but the movie focuses on them. I\\'d love to see a remake that tells more of Adam,charles and Cathy in her younger days. but mostly I\\'d like to see more of Samuel and Lee.\\nPossibly the greatest movie I\\'ve ever seen.\\nAdam, Cal\\'s father is actually the main character in the book. The book focus\\'s more on Kate and Adam until the end. The film cuts out half the book.\\n@dozza06 LOL\\nI love this movie, its not your typical story.\\nMonster. How should I feel? Creatures lie here. Looking through the window.\\nMeg and Dia wrote the song\"Monster\" based on Cathy Ames. ;D check it out\\nThis film was partially filmed in the town of Mendocino, Calif.

The buildings later burnt and were never rebuilt.\\ni love the song!!\\nI love the book (it\\'s actually my favorite one) and I\\'ve lately seen the movie, but I think the book is much better.\\nThis was turned into a song..... I think it\\'s this book but the songs called monitor by Meg and dia\\n@josefienmatu oh, you must be caucasian...\\nI cried at the end of the movie, when she says she knows how it feels when nobody loves you. actually I feel like this\\n@dammitblink It focuses just as much on the love story as the book does- considering it\\'s about a 4th of the books length, it just feels like more.\\n\\nI think the film\\'s amazing in spite of all that they cut out- it gets the central point of the book down, which is really the most important thing.\\ndean looks a bit like james franco\\nthis adaptation of the book looks completely and utterly ridiculous...\\nMakes me want to invest in a bean farm during these shitty economic times...Great flick..\\nWish I was born in that time\\nEast of Eden is a bullshit book. Worst I\\'ve ever read in my entire life. No meaning, substance, just a fuckload of symbolism and negative opinions of females. Overly detailed, good description of scenes though, but the plot utterly boring and not frustrating. Hated it, total dissappointment\\ni hate how lee is barely in the film. he\\'s my favorite character in the book!\\nthis is a great movie\\nI haven\\'t seen the movie but I love the book and I\\'ve heard the movie focuses too much on the love story that actually isn\\'t that emphasized in the book but I\\'m not surprised.

I have the box set but not with me now. sure wish i could see at least the first 3 on utube\\nYou\\'re completely right, but don\\'t forget that in 1936 already Hollywood made \"After the Thin Man\", because they just wanted to make a quick buck on the back of the original movie.\\nA lot of them began on stage (vaudeville, Broadway) and they were usually taught to speak with a Mid-Atlantic accent and I personally love them. Lines were dictated better with the accent and I just think it sounded better overall. We are lazy speakers now! I\\'d actually like to teach myself how to speak with this accent (and keep it permanently!)\\n@Drake59 I like Johnny Depp, but it is a shame that Hollywood of today has to remake classics because they have no idea what to do, or do they?  I think they are lazy and they want to make a quick buck on the back of classics instead of making new good movies. They rarely succeed with them. The majority of movies these days fall into the category of stupidity and vulgarity. There are still some good movies made, but the ones worth watching never get the proper promotion.   It\\'s a shame!\\nWhat a Joy!  I bought the series of Thin Man movies and I just watched the first one tonight and it was wonderful.  Witty and funny and everything comedies are not these days.  The most wonderful thing about the movie is that they did not have to be vulgar to be funny.  I will watched the second one from the series tomorrow.\\nWhy do old hollywood actors speak so funny?

How about just showing the movie clips. The music doesn\\'t even fit with it. Horrible\\nBette Davis\\'s electrifying on the scene. Curiously, Of Human Bondage was unsuccessful in 1934. The criticisms were mixed about the film. The public didn\\'t tolerate the way the waitress Mildred (Bette Davis) had infuriated the young medical student Philip (Leslie Howard). In between the lines the moralistic discourse is evident: educated males should not be involved emotionally with vulgar females and without cradle. Several RKO Radio Pictures stars declined to play Midred. However, Bette Davis\\'s performance was highly praised and she was elevated to star status, not beauty, for the appearance of the waitress was sloppy, but for the talent. The absence of Bette in the nominations for the Oscar of better actress generated protests. The compensation came the following year, when she received the award for a performance that neither she liked in Dangerous. When Of Human Bondage went into production Bette was hired by Warner and was not satisfied with the production system, which didn\\'t always give priority to quality. The actors participated in one production after another, and sometimes up to two at the same time. This was because the studios had to feed the movie circuits, all week, with new tapes. As everyone knows, there was no television and the most accessible entertainment was the movies. Bette starred in 22 films before Of Human Bondage. She had good roles in The Cabin in the Cotton, 20,000 Years in Sing Sing and The Working Man, but was not so lucky in other jobs. To be part of the cast of Of Human Bondage, Bette still had to participate in Fog Over Frisco, in which her character is murdered and disappears before the story ends. In 1934, the actress had already acted for Warner in Fashions of 1934 and Jimmy the Gent. Soon after Of Human Bondage, did, also, in the same year, Housewife.\\nThank, this is exactly what I needed for my blog!\\nI really like your videos. I hope you continue to make more!

Somerset Maugham and tells the story of a failed artist who decides to study medicine. He becomes completely infatuated with a young waitress who is intent on breaking his heart over and over. It is only finally when she dies that he can break free from the bond that ties him to her.

Previously, Dick Powell was known only for comedies and musicals, so his appearance in a film noir makes Murder My Sweet an especially unique choice for your mystery collection. His name is Phillip Marlowe, and for the right price, this private eye will follow an unfaithful husband, find a missing bankroll, or spy on a suspicious neighbor. When he\\'s drawn into a complex web of murder, blackmail and double-dealing, the result is the quintessential film-noir—the one that set the standard for the noir genre.\\nPT2M9S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::429\\n5665 18 0 0 1\\n\\nPT1M44S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::430\\nRussell forever the best.\\nNo there is no Air Raid.

At its center is Brian Cohen, born in Bethleham in a stable next door, who, by a series of absurd circumstances is caught up in the new religion and reluctantly mistaken for the promised messiah, providing ample opportunity for the entire ensemble (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) to shine in mulitple roles as they question everyone and everything from ex-lepers, Pontius Pilate and haggling to revolutionaries, crazy prophets, religious fanaticism, Roman centurions and crucifixion, forever changing our biblical view.\\nPT2M51S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::434\\nPosta o filme completo...\\nThe voice over\\xa0 sounds like the guy who did all the Disney home\\xa0VHS promos back in the 90\\'s\\n@mrgiosb123 KIRO\\nWhat CBS Affiliate Was The Cal Worthington Ad On?\\n3506 13 1 0 4\\nA promo for the 1985 network premiere of Blake Edwards\\' hit comedy, starring Julie Andrews and James Garner.\\nPT54S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::435\\n1421 22 0 0 0\\nhttp://www.trailersfromhell.com\\nPT3M45S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::436\\nWacky Racers cartoon based on this I think.\\nOne of the great comedy movie ever made!

The story looks at what happens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he\\'s grateful for the work but isn\\'t the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who\\'s the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men\\'s room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Lionsgate (1992)\\nCast: Kirk Baltz, Edward Bunker, Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, Quentin Tarantino, Lawrence Tierney\\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\\nProducers: Lawrence Bender, Richard N.

He\\'s so intense yet neutral in almost every situation(to Barnes when he\\'s about to kill Chris) \"Don\\'t do it man that\\'s 10 years you\\'ll climb the walls!\"  The kind of fellow american you would want by your side b/c he has a heartsoul, he\\'s logical and a badass. I wonder if that end scene when he\\'s waving goodbye to Chris , where he raises his rifle and does a primalistic war roar was improv..one of the great movies\\nI miss my buddies and the good and bad times we have during our combat deployment.\\nI don/t like Oliver\\'s tone.\\nGreat movie about a terrible war, not just for Americans but for Australians and no doubt the people of Vietnam. So proud of my Father who is a vet and dealt with he experiences for years. Bless you all!\\nPS.I only noticed at the end - right at the moment of the credits - that there were names here\\xa0like Johnny Depp or Forest Whitaker in it!...It is incredible how many future\\xa0cinema-LEGENDS are in this movie!...Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe and - to be honest - this is probably the BEST interpretation of Tom Berenger. Most of his movies\\xa0he plays characters that are almost \"laughable, but HERE HE IS REALLY SCARY! - Stone choose the actor to play this role well (I wonder BY WHOM WAS THIS \"CHARACTER INSPIRED?? :) ) -\\xa0and must have schooled him well, too.\\xa0This is the only movie where I see Berenger not only \"scary\", but almost \"trascendental\" - like he was Death himself - the\\xa0\"EPITHOMY OF WAR\" - the perfect Killing machine, with no feeling, conscience or fear - like the \"Pale\\xa0Rider\" himself.\\nThis is one of those \"never able to\\xa0forget\" movies\\xa0- a piece of LIVING HISTORY!...\\nGreat movie, \"Adgio For Strings\" fit this film PERFECTLY, for the haunting scenery & storytelling.\\ndamn look at the casts for this film, I guess Oliver Stone really had an eye for talent\\nwhat is the song in the trailer\\nOliver Stone should make a movie with Charlie Sheen again.\\nWhen the machine breaks down, we break down.\\nIts not too late to do something about the war in vietnam see platoon and understand\\nshould\\'ve been a great movie. why did they put charlie in it? that cunt belongs to comedy crap. if they replace charlie with rutger hauer, the movie\\'d have been epic like a real adult movie not some kid movie with a clown.\\nProbably the best movie trailer ever, no all capital words flashing across the screen.\\nWho can forget the glory of the American empire as it killed a million or so people in a country that didn\\'t threaten us at all? What a truly worthwhile, noble endeavor Vietnam was. \\xa0And look what we learned from our imperial war overseas: Absolutely nothing.\\nThis movie does not seem serious with the music in this trailer.. Is it good and is it serious? Showing the dark sides of the war in Vientnam? If not, I am looking for a BRILLIANT Vietnam war movie with no silly songs and serious actors.\\nThank you - Mr K\\nLol. Have you even seen this movie? It is the complete opposite of pro-US propaganda\\n1:35 \"the first real movie about the war in Vietnam is Platoon\"\\nUmm, Apocalypse Now?\\nI just saw this movie for the first time today. One of the best war movies I\\'ve ever seen.\\nSuch a good movie Willem Dafoe needs like a bunch of oscars for it\\nThis is by far one of the greatest movies ever created in the entire world.\\nOne of my favorite movies of all time. I grew up watching this since my dad was in the Vietnam war. It kinda gave me a glimpse of what he had to go through. I always cry watching this movie.\\nthis trailer deserves an oscar\\nwhich the start sound\\nHad this on DVD for years. Just watched it tonight with my 13 year old son. He said it was \"boring\" and \"nothing happen in it\".....? Nothing happened?? Fuckin kids today eh!!\\nIS THIS ROY ORBISON´S VOICE?\\nI dare you to name a better more realistic war movie than this\\nI love this movie having been in the army. Enlisted men associate with their platoon. Directors usually write for larger units like Company (Easy Company),\\xa0Regiment,\\xa0Brigades (Charge of the Light Brigade) or even massed Armies (the Longest Day). The average enlisted man does not associate with large groups like \"the Regiment\" or even the Division (like the 101st). That is for officers. The men understand the Platoon.\\xa0That is where their buddies are. Officers look down on the platoon and consider it cannon fodder - much the same as depicted in this movie.\\n0:57 Ribery ? o.o\\nThe one thing that seemed false is how this movie portrayed the alcohol users as crazy (Bunny) and criminal (Barnes) while the pot smokers Taylor and the others as the normal doing their job soldiers.\\xa0 Although I am USMC Vietnam Vet I wasn’t a grunt, but in boot camp, the regular Marine Corps and in the VA psych wards I talked to many Veterans that were grunts and every one said when they were on patrol when some idiot lit a joint they ended up walking into an ambush.\\xa0 I never heard of a person in a patrol that was intoxicated by alcohol.\\xa0 Personally from what I’ve heard and experienced anyone that would smoke pot while in combat was stupid.\\xa0 The left condones the use of marijuana and the right doesn’t.\\nStill best comedy out there, hilarious!\\nhmm, some days ago watched it and almost slept \\xa0whole time. 3/10\\nWith Barnes in charge, it really was a Platoon of Doom.\\n1:25 Nicholas Cage\\nFor those who don\\'t know, the song at the beginning is: Samuel Barber - Adagio For Strings Op. 11. You\\'re welcome.\\nare you kiddin me?i cant see a movie when charlie is serious.\\nLa mejor película sobre la guerra de Vietnam, y una de las mejores del genero\\nFMJ or Platoon ooooh that\\'s a hard one\\ni loved this movie\\nyou stupid sack of shit.\\nBESTBESTBEST\\nPerhaps one of the best antiwar movies ever made. It makes me sick to think about so many people dying needlessly in wars. These young men and women have their whole lives ahead of them only to be stripped away forever and for what?\\nWoman Cry For Titanic\\nUs Men Cry for Platoon\\nA favorite. Watched it many times.\\nryback at 1:25\\nShame is a little bit of reading too difficult for you? I\\'m African actually. When you\\'ve learned some real history and not the propaganda shovelled to you in school, then you\\'ll realise how rotten things really are.\\nFUCKchomskyFUCKyou\\n\\nDidn\\'t know North Korea has an outside Internet connection now, comrade.\\nNo Indochina did not exist by the time the USA started dropping bombs. They were three seperate countries: Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam (one country). Vietnam was militarily divided into two, this was temporary and not a political division. Elections were meant to be held as per Geneva agreements but the USA backed Diem government refused when the time came. They used this MILITARY division to claim that South Vietnam was a seperate country. That was a fallacy.\\nYeah that worked out great didn\\'t it? A country still technically at war, a civil war at that. Great. Do yourself a favour and read a bit:\\n\\nwwwDOTchomskyDOTinfo/articles/19700604DOThtm\\nThere was only ever a war for independence in Vietnam and that war was against the illegal invasion by the USA. As soon as the USA ran away and stopped pumping money into its puppet Saigon government, the whole show crumbled. The Viet Cong were southerners fighting against the USA and its proxy, puppet RVN, the Northerners only helped them in their struggle.\\nI guess the North Vietnamese soldiers were \"legally\" inside Cambodia.\\n\\nOh wait, Cambodia probably \"never existed\" too. A fiction.\\nI think you need to read up your history a little better, you will find that it was the Vietnamese who put an end to the Khmer Rouge perpetrated genocide in Cambodia. The USA illegally bombed Cambodia after playing a role in installing a puppet government that would allow them to do so. That is how the Khmer Rouge got a support base in the first place. There was never a war between North & South Vietnam, there were never two countries with those names. That was fiction created by the USA.\\nOh, and let\\'s not forget: South Korea doesn\\'t exist too. Huh?\\nYeah, it was a mass illusion. A fata morgana. Go and say Cambodia and Laos also never existed. It was all still Indochina.\\nMaybe the North Vietnamese and the Maoist Chinese shouldn\\'t arm and support the Khmer Rouge, huh? Maybe the North Vietnamese shouldn\\'t have occupied eastern Cambodia for their war against South Vietnam in first place? What the DMZ troubled them? They really, really HAD to make war, and to export communism to other countries too?\\nWhen every other country needs help the first one they look to is America!!The USA...and I am Kiwi making this statement\\nI think america is the last country on earth anyone needs to apologize to. like really, the last.\\nRead up about the use of chemical weapons, napalm, \\'willie-peter\\' and the amount of bombs dropped on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia (illegally). Read up about the repercussions of the American support for a Cambodian coup and then the bombing of that country which eventually provided the pool for Khmer Rouge recruitment. Then come back here and tell us about cruelty.\\nLearn to history monsieur:\\n\\nSouth Vietnam never existed, it was created by the Americans so that they could say that it was being invaded. Read up about the Tonkin Incident, as real as Saddam\\'s WMD. The Vietnam-American war was a war for Vietnamese independence against foreign invaders. The Americans never understood this and that is why they lost.\\nYou\\'re retarded, you know that, right?\\nchang is a name of some fucking chinese people right?\\nBest vietnam war movie !!!!\\nthe vietnamese were cruel, so the americans became cruel after seeing what the vietnamese did to the civilians and what they did to there prisoners, of course they got harsher they had to fight fire with fire\\nAmerican came to my country, killed my peole. What do you think about this? Did England, Japan,...... apologize your Country?\\neveryone was terrible to each other\\nNothing from 1986 is HQ.\\nThank god he did not have to because he pointed a gun in his fucked up head and blew his brains out....I wish that would be the fate of all mass murderers of humanity(including American army) and not apologies...\\nsure they should apologise to the people that killed their children,burned their villages and terrorize them for over a decade....\\nwhy the fuck would THEY apologize\\nfuck you son of a bitch\\n1764003 2169 76 0 912\\nTrailer for Oliver Stone\\'s film starring Tom Berenger,Willem Dafoe,Charlie Sheen,Forest Whitaker,Keith David,John C.

The general consensus was that the Jaye Davidson role was uncastable, the film\\'s mix of sex and terrorism would prove unpalatable with audiences, and that the press would divulge the film\\'s big twist. Eventually Woolley was able to drum up the necessary budget from British, European and Japanese sources, but then had to contend with the financial collapse of his production company, Palace Pictures. When Miramax, who had initially rejected the script, saw the finished product, they immediately made an offer to distribute the film in the USA, with a clause in the contract that they would push the film for Oscar consideration.\\n16429 41 0 0 2\\nAn unlikely friendship develops between a kidnapped British soldier and his captor, an IRA volunteer named Fergus.

Malden was a genius.\\nRealmente, Brando está soberbo nesse filme e, para um jovem ator, demonstra extraordinária coragem, ao fixar nas memórias a imagem de um cidadão sem escrúpulos. O filme todo é uma obra prima e surpreende a intensidade de sentimentos e o clima de tensão que se desperta e mantém, amplificado pela mediocridade do ambiente, que o cenário destaca.\\nGreat performance from Brando. Exciting movie. I think the introduction (theme and scene) is a masterpiece, creating the movie\\'s mood. Thank you.\\nWell....Stanley did rape Blanche...\\nAs much as I love this, Blanche is just so unlikable. She is entirely male dependent, and I actually hated her more than Stanley.

It\\'s a film at its finest! Well written, brilliantly acted, everything was surreal! I felt disturbed a little, and shaken by the acting performances of Leigh and Brando, not to mention the supporting cast. It was a very powerful film!\\n@ardistar9 Tom Hardy as Stanley !

Shouldn\\'t have watched this while eating an F-15.\\nI live in Ridgecrest which is right next to China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station and I have seen this fly into the base in the last year. So they may have one in a museum but they have at least two that are still flying.\\n40 UFO sightings between 96 and 99 explained :)\\nYep fuck the military for not revealing all of the secret projects they are working on that our enemies could get a hold of to use to kill our troops in the us military. Yes shame on the military.\\nMore like shame on you.\\nYeah.  I know what you mean.  All that rain has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that you live right next to the ocean.\\nThey fly bird like planes/drones over Eugene Oregon. I\\'ve seen them with my own eyes. I\\'ve seen them stop and hide in a cloud on a chemtrail day. Oh everyday is a chemtrail day in Oregon. I hate it up here. They fuck w the weather nonstop and patrol us w crap like this plane that supposedly in a museum. Fuck the NWO and the USAF for lying to the public.\\nWow a lot of money just to be put into a museam\\ndo you think they would ever make a civilian version of this without all the stealth capabilities and weapons technology. id much rather by that than an L-39\\n@ManifestMiasma I don\\'t think the F-22 does.\\nI wonder what the cockpit looks like from the inside. Probably just analog guages considering when it was built.\\nThis beautiful beast should have the X32\\'s powerplant and control systems installed into it.\\nThat is one F-ugly bird.\\nI wonder how small an emp device can be. Could it affect flight computers?\\n@datzfast Actually carbon fiber. Sometime back in 01-02 Popular Science had this as it\\'s cover article. All angles to deflect radar, carbon fiber body to absorb any remaining radar, and angled exhaust duct for the engine makes it hard for a heat seeker to find. Basically a showcase of a pure stealth aircraft. 7,400 pounds, top speed 260 knots, max altitude 20,000 ft.\\n@MrROTD U R clueless... must be Chinese or Russian... body count to spare...\\nThis is a pathetic try at trying to get your game back.  Fact is Mac D never had it...\\ncool is thaqt a real guy iin that plane\\nWe need a cheaper fighter before we learn the hard lesson the Germans did, numbers win wars more than  complex weapons can. Why the hell did my country buy F-22s? we can only afford like 10 of em lmao\\n@StellarBlue1 America still has the best weapons except frigates, our are best jk jk Fancy weapons alone dont win battles, look at WW11, the American tanks and rifles were inferior and not as fancy as the Germans but the allies still won.On the other hand I don\\'t think it\\'s Americas job to fuck the world lol sorry if that bums you out man.\\n@Templarium Yes the aircraft made 38 test flights for the Boeing Phantom Works division.\\ndid it actually flew?\\n@jeimi007 it\\'s not a weapon, it\\'s an aircraft to demonstrate technology. it has no weapons carring capability. in fact it\\'s been in storage for about 10 years.\\n@riche7711 To test new designs for low observable aircraft. make sure your new technology works before you design it into a prototype military aircraft. this was a boeing company project, entirely funded by boeing with no D.O.D. participation.\\n@cobrala Hey i already know, Ive seen some really interesting things as a pilot, but one of the main reasons they cant release it to the public is many are nuclear powered and the FAA and countless environmental agencies would absolutey flip shit if they knew that the military and civilian teams were flying these things over the population. And many of the things that are hidden away in these hangars are Alien Reproduction Vehicles.\\n@riche7711 Well you see everything you see in production is lagging behind.  Like you said by the time we can build, test and produce a new aircraft such as the F-35, scientists have already experimented and tested something better which will be applied to the next generation. I tell people all the time believe you me the US has stuff in secret hangers that you cant even imagine that is at least 20 years ahead of the F-22 or F-35. If we saw them now we would accidentally  call it alien\\nHonestly why would they need a stealth tech demonstrator? Doesnt the F-117, B-2, F-22A, YF-23, F-25, F-35 and all the other random X planes NASA and the CIA have work? They `ve been working on the F-22 almost as long as they developed the F-15. The US doesnt realese a technology nowdays unless they can already counter it. We have got crafts that will fly circles around any F-22 or Su-47. Would be a nice replacement for my Cessna.\\nSounds like porno music.\\n@Funderbunk Interesting, I wonder why they didnt continue with it.....BTW promise me you will give me a ride in the thing when you hit those powerball numbers! LOL!!!\\nIt seems that we have a trekkie inside the project, the aircraft, in some camera angles, looks a lot like a Klingon bird of prey! See at 0:18.\\n@Tobi1087Tobi\\nIts an observation aircraft.\\n@jdogbig1\\nIt could be used for recon and electronic warfare purposes.  Its main purpose was to demonstrate a number of things: functional capabilities;  new manufacturing processes; low cost (total project cost was $67million).\\nWhats the plane alongside Bird Of Prey ???\\nYou cant Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd...\\n\\n\"demonstrate stealth technology\", 1996? Wake-up!\\n\\n\\n\\nLook up F117, check its \"Official Dates\".\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1964, Pyotr Ya. Ufimtsev, a Russian mathematician, published a seminal paper, \"Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction\", in the Journal of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering, in which he showed that the strength of a radar return is related to the edge configuration of an object, not its size.\\n@starscream565  what makes you think that?\\nlooks like a paper airplane I once made.\\nWeird. Doesn\\'t look like something that would fly. I guess most of it\\'s body works as a wing...\\nOH yeah....well......well..... I gues you were honest LOL!!!\\n\\nHowever I dont...nor ever shall consider being a geek a bad thing. Maybe when I was in grade school and couldnt get a date.....that was a bad word....now Im living a life I would have never dreamed of back then!! So sure....being a Geek has been great to me! Thanks! Ive never been accused of being a tool though...U do know the words are not interchangable right?\\nnot reallly sure why... you just come across that way... A bit geeky is the way id describe it... i felt like sharing so... hope that helps?\\nuhhhhh alrighty then.....not sure what I said that made you call me a tool?!?!?!\\n\\nI guess ur a huge fan o\\' pysche warfare or sumthin\\' & dont like me talkin\\' smack about it???LOL!!!\\n\\nSeriously though......WTF did I say that deserved me being called a \"tool\"?\\nyes,ur a tool\\nOK I will check them out.....yeah I could not tell the shape very much of the first one I watched......its hard to tell when it is shot in the dark......I may send you a message to your site about what I think (easier to comment that way....I can have more space without having to trim everything) Anyway thanks.....\\n\\nKeep watching the skies.............I Want To Believe.......\\n\\n...The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence...generic pro-UFO catch phraise#11.......etc. LOL!!!\\nHi Brian,\\nSure quote it all you want it\\'s an old one here in Australia, see we are used to being treated like that by our politicians and such.\\n\\nIf you have time to catch some of my other videos, you may pick up on the similarity of shape that keeps re-appearing in my \"unknowns\". This is what leads me toward this craft, as I haven\\'t seen any other that fits the bill, yet.  That is if it is one of  Earth\\'s human craft?\\nBut I will keep on videoing as practice makes perfect as they say.TRUTH,\\nJim\\nRight....it is truley amazing what was come up with by the Nazi\\'s......Its not fun to admit...but they where well ahead of their time. Thank providence that we got em before they could perfect some of their more interesting designs....else our space program and Intellegence opperations would have been taken over by Nazis.....wait a minute....that happened anyway LOL!!! Oh well at least Nazi sympathisers like Prescott Bush didnt get into power....just his Grandkids LOL!!!\\nNot really....Im sure this is the aim of certain black ops project......people are less likely to shoot down a UFO....plus if it looks truly like a space craft...then enemy soldier may be afraid of reporting it for fear they will be rideculed...classic psych warfare......\\nVery interesting video.....I read a very convincing article that the so called \\'flying triangles\\' which are usually described as huge and silent are actualy hybrid hard shelled (made of high tech composite material light as cloth...but hard like steel) blimps which can move fast like an airplane or jet \\'cause of their aerodynamic shell. They have to be big to displace enough air. Cant say thats what this is though. PS I like your \\'mushroom\\' analogy...funny stuff...can I qoute it sometime?\\nConsidering these are old designs.\\nAs seen in my sky here in Australia (Video response)  the most likely culprit of new updated versions.  These far exceeding the specs on this video.  But Boeing still will not answer the phone on what they call the new version etc.\\n\\n\" We don\\'t give out operational data \"\\n\\nSo looks like we will be kept like mushrooms again....\\ni.e:-   you know... kept in the dark and fed bullshit.....  TRUTH.\\n\\nI believe they have active camouflage and  near space ceiling.\\nwell...honestly we were making aircraft like this back in the 40\\'s!!! Well at least the Nazi\\'s were....Did you see the Discovery Channels (I think,,,maybe it was the Science Channel...one of those though) episode where they reconstructed Hitler\\'s \"Stealth Bomber\"? The thing looked pretty much like our modern version...plus they experimented with flying wings...& even more exotic designs if U believe some authors.....\\nAs far as I know, they did not have any problems. The plane was stable and had no fly-by-wire. That is actually cool. Now it is only Burt Rutan who builds gorgeous, but simple and reliable planes.\\nI have always liked the cranked wing design. Have a look at Luft 46 designs by Blohm und Voss. The P208 for instance. Nothing new under the sun. They had jet powered version P210 on the drawing board in 1944\\nThey Should Call it ... The Night Crawler!\\nI am wondering if they had any aerodynamic problems with the unique design...If not they should have continued it IMHO. If for no other reason than it looks really....really....badass.\\n\\nAnd looking badass is half the battle.\\nCheck out the work of T.T. Brown or just look at the many \"lifter\" projects on the internet & Youtube. Its a proven Tech-arguably the same thing as in the Ionic Breeze. My research into T.T. Brown shows that He was using a slightly different technique than the \"lifter\" projects however. Also in the B2 configeration it likely gave added thrust more so than added lift. Also if they it made more of plasma it could reduce radarVis as well. Dont know if they did this...but its an interesting thought.\\nHa I qouted you without your permission!!! Take That guy I dont know!!!!!!\\nlol, thats just epic lol\\nLooks like nintendo should sue for their arwing design back :)\\nO.o... thanks for sharing xD that mus b rly hard for the scientist >.> there\\'s always panadol extra xD\\nO.o... im quite a stupid person... so how is active camoflague supposed to work? in some sense it blends in with the colours of the surroundings right? but many people might look at the air craft from different angles... so how is it supposed to make everyone see as thought its invisible?\\nhaha yes absolutely\\nI\\'m no aerodynamics major, but am a flight instructor. I would say the the \"winglet\" looking fins pointing down serve as the vertical stabilizer, while the shape of the entire aircraft along with the trailing edge control surfaces produce a horizontal stabilizing effect. Just observing though, don\\'t quote me on it.\\nIt was called that because from some angles it looked like a Klingon ship fron the star trek movies.\\nbird of prey.\\nYou have no clue what your talking about.\\nwow, amazing man. thanks for the information. god bless.\\ninteresting, so what happens when the edges are ionised? they produce electrogravitic levitation?!?! if so, what does that mean and do?\\nI think it looks kinda cool but.... It can\\'t accurately be called a \"bird of prey\" because frankly.... IT HAS NO DEFENSE OR OFFENSE!!!!!\\nThat thing is ugly, I hate those mutant aircraft. My dream is to shoot them all down. And that thing is easily downed with a WW2 Fighter or Inteceptor. And so can u do with B-2. If u find it, u dont need anything hi-tech to take it down.\\nIt\\'s certainly badass, but still behind yf-23 and B-2 in my book. Cheer:)\\ni would be very poud if thay call this the Phantom III!\\nit goes only 260knots so i have no idea\\nMan, where does the thing get its lift?\\nI dissagree by a long, long shot.  But hey it\\'s all just personal preference :)\\nGot to be the most badass aircraft in history in terms of looks.\\nWow it kinda looks like the ship from nintendos star fox.\\nA very slick looking aircraft.  Now we know why some people report seeing UFOs.  It basically looks like it shouldn\\'t be able to fly if you look at it from certain angles.\\nThe big issue at boeing is their management sometimes crushes innovative projects just because they are outside the box they have a dilbert type situation.\\n\\nThe Boeing JSF for example wasn\\'t a bad design just was a poorly managed program.\\n\\nThey need to rectify this maybe take a good long look at how things are done at software companies and the new aerospace companies.\\nQue Klingon music...\\nA very odd looking aircraft.\\nBen Rich, the Skunk Works guy behind the F-117, once said he could made a brick fly with fly-by-wire - this might just be the proof\\nWow, that is a real stunner. Thank you for all your videos, they are great.\\n135260 177 13 0 83\\nThe McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) Phantom Works built the Bird of Prey to demonstrate stealth technology.

It is a film that details the past of the brothers and their families through a series of flashbacks. The film is most notable for its shocking climax.\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Penn won the best supporting actor award at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for his performance.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlot:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers. These men are violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating. Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to Communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny\\'s opinions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief suspect in Johnny\\'s murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.\\n\\n\\n\\nRay and Chez swear revenge. Ray\\'s wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez\\' wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband\\'s obsessive nature.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who first claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend, but who later admits, just before Ray kills him, that he wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers\\' lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray\\'s house and shoots Ray\\'s bodyguards, shoots his dead brother Johnny lying in the casket, shoots Ray, and then puts the gun in his own mouth and commits suicide as the family women wail over Ray as he too dies.\\nPT2M21S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::453\\nKiller Rock n Roll!

The plant, which provides most of the jobs for those living in Amarillo, now operates as a disassembly-line where the weapons, which were once built there, are now being taken apart with the plutonium getting stored underground. The film deals with the issues of storing the plutonium and the effects the plant has had (and is having) on the town of Amarillo, as well as how it has affected the way people thought about the Cold War and its aftermath. It does so by taking a look at the lives and activities of the Amarillo residents directly or indirectly associated with, or having strong opinions about the Plant.

Those sailors vowed to return and that’s just what they do, using the fog that blankets this little seaside town as their method of transportation. Starring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh, the film was a solid success bringing in nearly $22 million on its $1 million budget. The Fog was remade in 2005, directed by Rupert Wainwright and starring Selma Blair.\\n\\nAs always, you can find more commentary, more reviews, more podcasts, and more deep-dives into the films you don\\'t know you love yet over on the Trailers From Hell mothership:\\n\\nhttp://www.trailersfromhell.com\\n\\nWhat\\'s that podcast, you ask?

It\\'s another game entirely to live in said scenery and to be at the mercy of nature.  That\\'s what sank home to me when I watched both movies back in the day as a youngster.  Water is the silver thread that links the episodes and the characters.  Water, and what some people will do to get what they need of it in a beautiful but harsh land.\\nNone of the above.  Beautiful but harsh.  Agricultural life dictated by the caprices of pitiless nature.

I\\'m currently watching this for my French 4 Class!!!\\nI had to watch this and the sequel, Manon of the Spring, in my French 1 & 2 class in college back in the early 1990s. Everyone in the class loved it--a fantastic film with no sex, no violence, no bad language, no special effects, just a plain, simple story with great acting. Most people don\\'t even know about this movie--a shame!\\nVery good French movie for those who love realism. It offers a great portrait of the human nature, no matter the nationality, because some things are simply universal. In this film, we are provided, on the one hand, the picture of kindness, strenuous effort, hope and trust in people, and, on the other hand, the picture of envy and pettiness. Besides, the actors and their performances are very good.\\njean de florette + manon des sources are 2 of my favorite movies. first time i saw them, it blew my mind!!!!!!\\nThis is  one of my favorite films ever.. wonderful....watch it...and its sequel....\\'Manon des sources\\'.\\nUn film absolument superbe, qui prend tout son sens quand on a vu la deuxième partie!\\n478498 771 33 0 156\\nJean de Florette (1986) Trailer\\n\\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091288/\\n\\nClaude Berri\\n\\nYves Montand, Gérard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, Elisabeth Depardieu\\nPT2M37S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::461\\nGoldie Hawn very sexy\\nThis is so good :)hahhah\\nWhat a crappy trailer...\\nlol I was looking for this movie for ages.

Spielberg, Lucas and Ford great combination. I wish somebody other than Ti West did the trailers of the Indiana Jones films.\\nWhat an astoundingly excellent film!  _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ [1981, Steven Spielberg] is arguably the #1 Greatest Action Film of All-Time* to this very day.

Spielberg’s brilliant staging of the familiar clichés from those beloved b-movies gave them a new lease on life and captivated younger audiences who showed up to the theaters in droves. Starring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, the bookish archaeologist and sometime action hero with a pathological fear of snakes (of course there are many snakes in this film). John Williams contributed the rousing score and Douglas Slocombe provided immaculate widescreen photography fit for a David Lean epic.\\n\\nAs always, you can find more commentary, more reviews, more podcasts, and more deep-dives into the films you don\\'t know you love yet over on the Trailers From Hell mothership:\\n\\nhttp://www.trailersfromhell.com\\n\\nCheck out our podcast, THE MOVIES THAT MADE ME, where you can join Oscar-nominated screenwriter Josh Olson and TFH Fearless Leader Joe Dante in conversation with filmmakers, comedians, and all-around interesting people about the movies that made them who they are.

The acting from De Niro is perfection, he really brings out the pure emotion in this movie, the scene where he is beating the wall still brings a tear to my eye. This is one of the only films that makes me cry, I\\'m a man and this story is so relatable. A man who\\'s life slowly destroys Itself doing the only thing he loves. His perception of life outside the ring never changes throughout the movie which ultimately is his downfall. I bow my head to you Martin Scorsese for making this genius piece of art. The fact that my girlfriend whom I have been with for over a year has only seen me cry once and it was to this film shows how much of a emotional roller coaster it is. Anyone reading this who hasn\\'t seen the film must do so now, you will not regret it. Still holds a place in my heart to this day.\\nThis is not a movie about boxing...

Lol.\\nRaging Bull is one of the greatest movies ever!\\nOne of the best films ever made. Its that simple..\\nIncredible Performance.I Think even better than J.Nicholson in One flew over the cockoo\\'s Nest and M.Brando on the Godfather.\\ngreatest boxing movie all time\\nI love this movie, but I have to ask; why cant nobody make a good Ray Robinson movie?\\nClassic!!!!!!!!\\nDeNiro you legend!\\nAwesome movie\\nOne of the best films ever\\nOne of the greatest movies of all time.\\ndamn this film is soooo good\\nDifferent kind of soul and heart in this film. I\\'d say they both have equal amounts of emotion, both just as raw as the other. You\\'re talking about two completely different films that emit completely different extremes. It\\'s like comparing \\'The Godfather\\', to \\'Goodfellas\\'. Two completely different films all together.\\nScorsese has always made great films\\nthe departed was atrocious\\nI\\'m my honest opinion, I like rocky better than raging bull because rocky had more soul and heart\\nWe all know that Rocky movies are the best trough history but sometimes can be forgotten.\\nAre you retarded or retarded?\\nOh really? So if someone asked you what the film is about, you\\'d tell them it\\'s about a man...\\nwhen i first watched it\\nBest Deniro & Pesci acting of all time\\nJust like taxi driver...\\nRaging bull IS BACK!\\nKnowing yourself is wiseness, knowing the others is superior wiseness.\\nYou see the thing is tho i was 17 when that comment was posted. 18 now since then lol. I know how youtube is im a teengager myself, i express myself on this site as well. i just got kind of bummed out when i found out my favorite film got invaded by a lot of imature children :(\\ni think pulp fiction / shawshank good bad and ugly are a step below kane and bull\\nEven the song to the trailer is a classic\\nlol that kind of invalidates my comment...funny stuff\\nremove \"boxing\" and your line would be correct\\nIf it\\'s true that they plan a remake with tom hardy I would be so damn happy\\nthats cause you are an idiot\\nBetter then the Godfather..imo the greatest movie ever made..\\nOne of the best films ever made. Dazzling. Just Dazzling.\\nThis film had great cinematography, brilliant actors and a beautiful soundtrack. Unfortunately it bored me because I didn\\'t care at all about any of the characters and their tragic lifes (except for the kids who witness violence). Other Scorsese films also have despicable characters (Goodfellas, Casino, The King of Comedy or even Taxi Driver) but all of those films glued my eyes to the tube/screen. Pity I can\\'t appreciate this masterpiece (even though Scorsese is one of my favourite directors).\\nWell, that\\'s pretty much the distinction made between a great movie & a good movie.  Raging Bull is a great movie.  The Departed is a good movie.\\nThe people comparing this to Rocky are either retards or teenagers desperate to be cool. The only thing they have in common is boxing. Rocky is about courage, and emerging from the slums. This is a story about redemption and character study. Rocky is closer to a fairy tail, it\\'s fictional. This is a BIOGRAPHIC film. So stop, right fucking now. If you\\'re still comparing them then you\\'re an idiot.\\nAre you sure that you\\'re 30? Because you talk like a kid...\\nOh my God! How can you do`nt understand? I didn\\'t compare each other. I just said that The Departed was a good movie. I didn\\'t compare them. I prefer Raging Bull than The Departed, but as I said, I DIDN\\'T COMPARE EACH OTHER!\\nSorry dummy Im far from a hipster....but I just dont think the Departed is anywhere on the same galaxy with movies that Scorcese made earlier in his life such as Mean Streets / Taxi Driver / Raging Bull...The Departed is over-sensationalized CRAP...sure the move is entertaining - but thats where it ends - it doesnt go anywhere deeper in terms of studying the characters as oppose to his previous movies which so beautifully showed why these people did what they did and what got them there\\nFirst of all calm down ...I really dont care what movies you like so I wont be searching anything..Here is the thing..Im glad you have a great taste in movies but at 15 there are only certain things you know about life, and when u get to my age (im 30) you will have a different apprecation of movies then you had at 15....same as when I get to 45, 60 ect I will have a different apprecation for movies as well...when you hit 30 you will see the difference between the 2...and the difference is HUGE\\nShut up. You don\\'t even know me e and are saying that I have a 75- IQ and I don\\'t have a good cinema taste. You are so fool, that you don\\'t know what you read. I DIDN\\'T COMPARE THE DEPARTED AND RAGING BULL! What an idiot ¬¬\\n\\nPS: If you want to know what movies I like, search Facebook Arthur Azir.\\n\\nPSS: I\\'m not a \"20 year old kid\". I\\'m fifteen and I have a GREAT cinema taste.\\nWell fuck you too. You sound like a hipster tool, going against the grain for the sake of standing out...\\nHey dummy..Im not a critic...im just a person who has watched movies for a long time.So I went on here and said that compared to RB that the Departed is a piece of shit..and it is..and if you had an iq higher then 75 and any sort of cinema taste or background you would see the same...but you are most likely some idiot 20 year old kid that took movies 101 and think QT is a god..again if you that that the departed is on same galaxy as raging bull - then you are lost and there is no help 4u\\nthe only one who thinks the departed is bad? sure if you ask all your jerk off 16 year old friends they will all tell you they loved it..but plenty of people dislike it - they gave scorcese best director more as a lifetime achievement award for him being snubbed so many times...maybe i shouldnt say its horrible..but The Departed is certainly a VERY BAD movie when you compare it to his other classics especially Raging Bull..its not even a top 10 of the movies hes directed..but you\\'re 2 dumb 2c it\\nYou are the only one who thinks the Departed is bad. It\\'s a literal fact that it isn\\'t...\\nWhat? I think you are one of those \"critics\" who prefer Casablanca than The Godfather.\\n1275443 1975 61 0 807\\nThis is a trailer of 1980\\'s movie Raging Bill, starring Robert DeNiro playing Jake LaMotta.\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on the life and career of boxer Jake LaMotta.\\nPT2M13S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::494\\nWilliam Friedkin is a genius director.

Welles’ vivid turn as corpulent bent cop Quinlan provided one of the genre’s most memorable villains.\\n\\nIniquity south of the border also colours Welles’ prior film noir, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), starring his then-wife Rita Hayworth.\\n\\n\\nWatch more on the BFI Player: http://player.bfi.org.uk/\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BFI\\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BritishFilmInstitute\\nFollow us on Google+: https://plus.google.com/+britishfilminstitute/\\nPT1M33S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::499\\nToday Commemorates Marcello Mastroianni\\'s 95th Birthday <3\\nMM was the Best Italian leading man and JP Belmondo was the best French leading man.

Who made those old people purchase the lands without them knowing it and how ?\\nThe way Huston, as Noah Cross, hisses the word \"anything\" sends a chill down the spine...\\nI don’t know why, but I just can’t get over this first scene. The way affection is expressed between Mr. G and Mrs. M, along with the beautiful score in the background, the entire scene is just beautifully crafted. And it puts me in a place I’m so unfamiliar but familiar with.. (that feeling when you let yourself be vulnerable with someone else)\\nChina town with no chinese in it..lol ducks\\nGreat film, too bad Polanski is such a sicko.\\n\"A case that has shadowed him to this day.\" Gosh, I wonder why?\\nYou know it\\'s a good movie when you want to repeat the whole movie after the ending credits, so that you can pick up the endless hidden clues.

The artist can be ridiculed and even destroyed. But their art - if it honestly stands on its own merits should be respected.\\nTop to bottom - *a perfect film!*\\nOne of the most underrated films..\\nBrilliant story. It is so rare for us nowadays to get such an intelligent screenplay. Instead we get giant stupid robots and mind numbing ghosts.\\nTo be honest, I think Penn\\'s \"Night Moves\" is just as good.\\nAmazing series of videos, truly.\\ndirection of a film is more important than its production\\nI don\\'t know why but Donald Trump comes to mind.\\nGreatest movie of all time!\\nFilm making does not get any better. Brilliantly crafted in every aspect.\\nFavorite Polanski film and my favorite noire film\\nNicholson\\'s best performance  (along with Cuckoos Nest, Last Detail)..\"Chinatown\" is brilliantly written with a superb, intricate  plot.Polanski typically manages to create a dark, ominous tone as only he  can..Dunaway is superb John Huston is simultaneously charming and frightening..One of the great films of that magnificent 70\\'s decade..I\\'m quite content to  watch this , Mean Streets, The Conversation,Godfather, Annie Hall, All the Presidents Men etc on DVD and forever stay in the 70s\\nI don\\'t think the film is about evil. Evil is hidden in this movie, because it\\'s weak. You can have all the \"power\" in the world, like the old man, and you can own your daughters, but they hate you. The true story is about Jack\\'s character, who tried to do the right thing on every turn, but he was so fanatic that he left himself vulnerable to defeat.\\n....and both ,Polanski and Capra were in a round table while making a program about cinema. They had a tendency to argue obviously.\\n@malows1234 I agree that Nolan could be making more original movies, but I certainly don\\'t agree that Batman should be directed by Bay. That\\'s just insane. The recent Batman movies are fortunate to have a good director behind them, and The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are more than just action scenes. :| Compare TDK to Transformers 3.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t worry, it\\'s not like Batman is the only thing Nolan\\'s been doing. Inception?\\n@malows1234 Wait, so you bash Nolan films and then call Memento a masterpeice? :|\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, I agree about Batman. TDK is a great movie but it\\'s not quite a masterpeice.\\n@malows1234 If by Batman you mean The Dark Knight, then you must be mistaked.

The acting is great, and I like how it differed from other westerns.  Though My favorite film that eastwood directed was gran torino. Fuck slumdog millionare and the dark knight, that should have won best picture.\\nUnforgiven was the film that sparked my interest of Westerns. It also made me a fan of Clint Eastwood. I love the set design and the story line in Unforgiven. Without it, I wouldn\\'t be interested in westerns, let alone Clint Eastwood! I saw other Eastwood films like J. Edgar. Unforgiven launched me into liking westerns and Clint Eastwood! Unforgiven is not only my favorite western, but also my favorite Clint Eastwood of all-time!\\nUnforgiven is a fantastic film, but I would put the searchers and the good the bad and the ugly before it on a best westerns ever list. Imo of course.\\nUnforgiven: Best Western Ever! The cast is brilliant! Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris deliver fantastic performances! Unforgiven is a masterpiece!\\nI wish for one day Clint would wear the poncho again you see in the background\\n0:40 - 1:53 Very valuable.\\nSuch an excellent film, deeply moving - wonderful performance from Clint and Freeman\\nMerry Clintsxmas everyone!!!\\nHappy Birthday, Clint!\\nHappy Birthday, Clint :)\\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, CLINT!\\nhappy bday clint\\n@skyaftermath 4th in fact\\njust watched High Plains Drifter today. happy birthday clint\\na true living legend, enjoy your day mr. eastwood!\\nhappy birthday clint\\n22356 119 1 0 20\\nLegendary American Film icon Clint Eastwood on making UNFORGIVEN, and on making a Western film more true to what living in that time period might have really been like.\\nPT2M36S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::506\\nStarring: Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, Carter Page, and Paul Manafort\\nGood movie but not Frankenheimer\\'s best.\\nI\\'ve never seen this film, but I\\'m interested.

Cary Grant shows what a great comedy actor he can be as a member of the twisted Brewster family. The movie was shot in 1941 but not released until 1944 when the Broadway version had finished its run. Boris Karloff played the demented Jonathan Brewster on Broadway, but opted out of being in the movie. He was replaced by Raymond Massey who give a deliciously evil performance. The constant reference to Jonathan looking \"like Karloff\" is a joking reminder of who actually played Jonathan. The \"movie\" that Aunt Abby was so frightened by and influenced Peter Lorre\\'s Dr. Einstein is \"Frankenstein\" which of course starred Karloff.\\nLove this movie it’s great, too too funny Cary Grant is awesome in this.

I\\'ll never forget, we ran out of time - she had to stop the film right when, dum dum DUUUM, brother Jonathan walks in to the dark house!!! What a cliffhanger.

It is a collection of five vignettes, taking place during the same night, concerning the temporary bond formed between taxi driver and passenger in five cities: Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. Jarmusch wrote the screenplay in about eight days, and the choice of certain cities was largely based on the actors with whom he wanted to work.[1] The soundtrack of the same name is by Tom Waits.\\nPT2M24S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::514\\nThis is a very good film. The colors used really appeal to the eyes. The film could be seen as a criticism of the Chinese contemporary government.\\nBought mine from Amazon. Great movie.\\nChina hated it this movie because this is what they carried. They couldn\\'t face their own TRUTH that they still do this. They think it\\'s a discrimination for doing this; however, HOW IS IT REALLY?\\n\\nI ain\\'t no Chinese, but I see the fallacy in China.\\nIf I wasn\\'t all packed up (moving) I would put this on. It\\'s amazingly beautiful and horrible simultaneously. Easily in my top 10 movies of all time. Saw it on bravo way back in the 90s when I was a teenager and then not again until 10 years later. It stayed with me through that decade and when I saw it again it was just as magical as the first time. The visuals are incredible/perfect, as is the music. Really amazing.\\nI love this movie so much\\nOne of my top 10 movies of all times.Great plot and convincing acting.I adore this movie.\\nApplauding after finishing it\\n\\nI TOPUGHT THIS WAS THE REAL RED LANTERNS\\n\\nits because of the music. if it had suspensefull music you would feel different.. its sad what hollywood does to the average veiwwer these days.\\nNo I recommend - it is one of my favs and not depressing at all just because it is a bit sinister. The film as a whole is fab.\\nit\\'s quite depressing, for sure.\\nbut i can ensure you it\\'s less boring than most french movies. :)\\nJB HiFi in the chinese secton\\nGong Li what a great actress\\nCan you recommend Chinese directors who do not cater so much to western views?\\nI already watched this movie.. All I can say is that it\\'s very beautiful, it tackles the story of rich landlord on china with their concubines. I love the story, hatred of the concubines to each other, their competition to win the admiration and attention of the master of the house. But in the end, the main antagonist fail and this lead to her to insanity.\\nBeen trying to find it on DVD in Australia, any clues anyone?\\n\\nluv this movie.....\\n@Sexyred0682 Netflix definitely has it. And it\\'s currently available. Look again.\\nI wish someone would put the whole movie up here or a link to watch the movie.  I cant find it anywhere.  I searched the web and couldnt find it, Netflix doesnt have it either. :-(\\nI had seen this before when I was in highschool, I watched it when i couldn\\'t sleep and found myself disturbed with what I\\'ve see.

Talented actors and director\\ni saw this one myself YEARS AGO it was very good~DD\\nthe end is unexpecting\\nway to give away the story\\ncould somebody help me! movie websites say this film is 125 mins long, but i got it from torrents and it runs 5 hours +. could you explain me whats with this long version? it is surely that film, it says RTRL right in the beginning.\\nGong Li is amazing\\nThis movie gave me goosebumps, although we already have enough TV series about concubines in the palaces, which is even more complicated and worse. It\\'s just... so realistic about how this still happens in a time when there are no longer emperors with dozens of wifes wishing to become empresses, in a normal wealthy family. Once you are involved in the game, you have to play it till the end, and you can\\'t lose, or it will be you who are gotten rid of.\\n@webbster5296\\n\\nAnd when one of them wants to play the game (like the second wife), no one else except those who are no longer threats to her can avoid it or stay away from it. If they win, they win the husband, the chances to bear sons, and the positions; but if they lose, they might lose everything -- including life.\\nThis movie pissed me off. Everything bad that happened to her was her own fault. If she had chosen that lifestyle she could have at least played along and just appeased the guy so she would have the lanterns and foot massages. But no, she had to complain like a little girl about everything and make it worse for herself.\\nmine too warneka thanks\\nwtf kind of trailer is this, they might as well show the whole movie already, everything is in the trailer, totally spoiled.\\nThis movie is so good. China wanted it banned.\\nthis is one of my favorite movies, but u can buy it in the store and its also on netflix.\\nYimou was such an incredible film maker back then. now he basically sucks.\\nI Love this film I saw it ages ago...\\nI saw a few minutes of this movie a few years ago, thinking I\\'d be heading for the next channel, but couldn\\'t stop watching!  It\\'s a totally amazing piece of cinematic art.\\ntheres this movie called \"to live\" and i think its by the same director or somethign and has some of the same actors\\nOh gosh I know this film.I watched it when I was little and I remember I was very impressed by that.\\n\\nCan someone recommend to me more such great movies\\nGon Li could raise my red lantern anyday! yowza....\\nHaunting and amazing film. Zhang Yimou is a master film maker: Ju Dou, To Live aka Lifetimes, The Story of Qiu Ju, Happy Times, Shanghai Triad, Not One Less, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower. Gong Li is simply gorgeous. Classy lady and ever so talented.\\napparently there are two dvd versions of this, 2006 and 2007... the bad one was the 2006 one, and the better quality was 2007.  Check out on amazon, thats where I saw the info on the dvd.\\nI could only watch this on a grainy DVD with crap sound and cliche\\'d badly translated subtitles.

I tie this with Raiders of the Lost Ark in this saga.  Harrison Ford and Sean Connery great team.  The highest grossing film in 1989 worldwide.  It was second in the U.S. To Tim Burton\\'s BATMAN. A great year for movies including Lethal Weapon 2 and Back to The Future Part II.\\nFor all of young Ti\\'s enthusiasm over the stunt where the man is supposed to jump from a horse to a moving tank, he fails to pint out that it is a fake. the camera is placed in front of the tank, with the man on horse back behind it. Because of the lense used, we don\\'t really see how much space is between the horse rider and the tank. We see the man jump off the horse, and then we cut to a different angle to see Indy landing on a platform.For all we know, the stunt man just jumped off the horse as he came up to a pile of boxes, set out between the track of the tank and the rider . A rather standard stunt.\\nLast Crusade is so uneven. More comedy than adventure with too many silly scenes which vastly undercut the serious parts. Indy\\'s father is so dumb he shoots off the tail of the plane they are in and he actually seems surprised! Raiders is the only one of the 4 I really like even though it does have that flaw at its center which Big Bang Theory did an entire episode about.\\nThree pretty good movies, then they decided to make Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull\\nour shitshuashion hash not improved\\nThis kid Ti West really cracks me up.\\xa0 I\\'m very supportive of his enthusiasm for a film that he was so excited for as a child, but I assure you when I saw this on a Thursday night in 1989, most everyone walked out (myself included) with a ho-hum opinion of this film.\\xa0 I wish it had been better.\\xa0 But the only thing that was great about it was A) the marketing, and B) the fact that Sean Connery was in it.\\xa0 Last Crusade was filled with missed opportunities, in terms of visual storytelling.\\xa0 The shots were mostly badly chosen or framed, and the editing was about as good as it can be, given what the editor had to work with here.\\xa0 Don\\'t get me started.\\xa0 This was not a homerun.\\xa0 I am very happy that a portion of the public responded well to it, and that the Freshmen students in one of my morning classes were excited enough to argue with me LOL about whether or not it was a good movie ....\\xa0 hahahahaha\\xa0 HOWEVER,\\xa0 it was fairly close to being lackluster.\\xa0 Especially in comparison to Raiders.\\xa0 I wish Ti West well, but kid, the experience your generation had, and the experience that our generation had, were two very different experiences.\\xa0 Not that I don\\'t have a sense of humor about it, but I cannot see this film the way you do.\\xa0 It was an unexpected disappointment.\\xa0 But LOVE your movie, Ti.\\xa0 Don\\'t let anybody ever tell you differently.\\xa0 Including me.\\n\\naka Indiana Jones and the Quest for Cash\\nI don\\'t understand people that say CRUSADE was their favorite. \\xa0CRUSADE was one step above CRYSTAL SKULL, which was completely unwatchable. \\xa0RAIDERS is by far the best, TEMPLE was also great. \\xa0But CRUSADE was terrible, a movie that just didn\\'t work, and it marked the point where Spielberg had gone crazy and lost touch with the character of Indiana Jones. \\xa0Terrible movie.\\nMy favorite of the Trilogy.\\nAnd let the  crystal skull rest in oblivion.\\nLove this movie saw all three Indiana jones films when I was 14 in 1998 on tnt\\n17868 109 2 0 21\\n\\nPT3M7S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::519\\nI never cared for either the book or the movie of \"Being There,\" as they seem heavy-handed to me.

The year is 1959, and Ingemar (Anton Glanzelius) is fixated by two major events - his namesake fighting for the World Heavyweight boxing title; and the fate of Laika, a dog sent into space by the Soviets. Fatherless and faced with his mother\\'s imminent death, Ingemar identifies with Laika\\'s journey into the unknown as he searches for a place among his eccentric new family - often with hilarious results. Winner of the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film, and nominated for two Academy Awards, My Life as a Dog is one of the most tender, nostalgic portraits of childhood ever put to film.\\nPT3M1S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::523\\ncontrary to the narrator they don\\'t go to another galaxy Altair is the 6th closest star outside of our solar system in deep space but within our Milky Way Galaxy\\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=FORBIDDEN+PLANET&sxsrf=ACYBGNStalhgGYMlMTTaY8N3Y0sSGlWLhQ:1578517330060&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjFk-ul8_TmAhU-JzQIHYDTD_AQ_AUoAXoECBYQAw&biw=1920&bih=967\\nLove this film!\\nMorbius wasn’t part of the lost civilization, the Krell.

They have based their comdemations on two books, one pitched by the Metropolitan Museum in New York. \\xa0(To Be Continued)\\nCont....Those against Stein would point out that she could have left France and returned to America (she was never interned) whilst also noting that she provided a positive character statement to an imprisoned Bernard Fay just AFTER the war. Also you state that France was Nazi occupied during both wars which is incorrect as the Nazis weren\\'t formed until 1920.  What academics do agree on though is that she was actually staunchly conservative which is something of a paradox.\\nI know she is Jewish, thanks for stating the obvious though. In my original post you seem to have missed that my second sentence was a question not a statement (the answer to which is \\'no\\' as I\\'ve since discovered). Regardless of her motives she was still collaborated with France\\'s Vichy government through Bernard Fay, was an admirer of Philippe Petain and agreed to translate around 180 pages of his anti-Semitic speeches into English.\\nI hope this is a joke. Stein... think... Stein... She\\'s Jewish. She was a Jewish woman living in Nazi-occupied France during both wars. What would you do if you were in the same situation and wanted to survive? Get your sources straight. She\\'s the most left-winged of the left-winged.\\nGertrude Stein. Didn\\'t she support Franco and petition for Hitler to be awarded the Nobel prize in 1938?

He discovered that his students responded to art - art taught his way, not the way it is usually taught in public schools.

The students named themselves K.O.S. which stands for \"Kids of Survival. \"What we\\'re doing changes people\\'s conception about who can make art, how art is made, who can learn and what\\'s possible, because a lot of these kids had been written off by the school system.

Warm and cozy inside their palatial villa, Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), and Shelley\\'s wife Mary (Elsa Lanchester) engage in morbidly sparkling conversation. The wicked Byron mockingly chastises Mary for frightening the literary world with her recent novel Frankenstein, but Mary insists that her horror tale preached a valuable moral, that man was not meant to dabble in the works of God. Moreover, Mary adds that her story did not end with the death of Frankenstein\\'s monster, whereupon she tells the enthralled Byron and Shelley what happened next. Surviving the windmill fire that brought the original 1931 Frankenstein to a close, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly revives and goes on another rampage of death and destruction. Meanwhile, his ailing creator Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) discovers that his former mentor, the demented Doctor Praetorius (Ernst Thesiger), plans to create another life-sized monster -- this time a woman! After a wild and wooly \"creation\" sequence, the bandages are unwrapped, and the Bride of the Monster (Elsa Lanchester again) emerges. Alas, the Monster\\'s tender efforts to connect with his new Mate are rewarded only by her revulsion and hoarse screams. \"She hate me,\" he growls, \"Just like others!\" Wonderfully acted and directed, The Bride of Frankenstein is further enhanced by the vivid Franz Waxman musical score; even the film\\'s occasional lapses in logic and continuity (it was trimmed from 90 to 75 minutes after the first preview) are oddly endearing. Director James Whale was memorably embodied by Ian McKellen in the Oscar-winning 1998 biopic Gods and Monsters.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Universal (1935)\\nCast: Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Valerie Hobson, Elsa Lanchester\\nDirector: James Whale\\nProducer: Carl Laemmle Jr.\\nScreenwriters: John L.

There\\'s nothing else on my body that comes close to the size of a melon, more\\'s the shame..... :) The film\\'s what you want it to be by the way, i like my theory and i\\'m sticking with it!\\n\\'Expand your melon\\' honey I don\\'t even know your name\\nDo you have any imagination whatsoever?! You too Wendy Testicle Burger, expand your melon some!!\\nReally? I thought it was a horror movie about a man who kills teenagers in their dreams\\nFavorite horror movie\\nImo this film is an analogy for the shooting of JFK. John F (Freddie) K (Kruger)\\'s assassination was considered the death of the American Dream, which in turn was represented by teenagers. JFK was shot on ELM STREET, turning the \"Dream\" into a \"Nightmare\". FK is the American Bogeyman. As it says in the film, \"Don\\'t fall asleep!\". In post 9/11 America, NOW is the time to WAKE UP!!!!\\nYou\\'ve misunderstood.  It was inspired by a sleep syndrome (Night Death Syndrome) that some have suffered from in Southeast Asia.  However, the deaths had nothing to do with nightmares or sleeping, but rather they were proven to suffer from a particular heart rhythm disorder called the Brugada Syndrome--again, linked to people from southeast Asia.\\nwes craven said him self about something he heard that people were dieing in there sleep thats how this movie came about look it up for yourself\\nThis movie is the best\\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\\n2870023 4019 232 0 1602\\nThe Original Elm Street trailer.\\nPT1M54S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::548\\n7176 13 0 0 0\\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces Trailer 1997\\nDirector: Barbra Streisand\\nStarring: Barbra Streisand, George Segal, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall, Pierce Brosnan, Elle MacPherson\\n\\nOfficial Content From Sony Pictures Home Entertainment\\n\\nBarbra directs and stars in this joyful romp about two best friends who agree to a platonic marriage.

H.B.O was allowed in to shoot the entire Trial and this is the ONLY thing that saved the lives of these three kids..\\nThe H.B.O-program was meant to show the Satanic Cult and their punishment but they soon realised what was happening and what a joke the entire Criminal System in America really is..\\nWhat I don\\'t understand is, why was there a documentary made DURING the trial process?  Who lets cameras film their personal thoughts and criminal trial?  Since when do courts allow cameras behind closed doors?\\nbut why would they confess to such a chilling act....that part is too much for me to deny. I wonder if these boys used the system to get out--IT’S HIGHLY POSSIBLE JUST AS MANY THINGS ARE IN THIS WORLD. These guys NEVER DENIED IT what also is odd to me\\nIT WAS THE FATHER!\\n@jk4d  I DO think Terry Hobbs had something to do with this (didnt write that comment on this video as i have on other WM3).  What I had meant to say was that there was no evidence from the WM3 themselves. There was hair from Hobbs and the knife from Byers but not evidence pointing to the WM3 themselves. My thought was based on reading the callahan site, articles online and yes, i saw the movies too.. I did a lot of reading and I still do sometimes.\\nprove this shit!!!...because they listen metal, they are guilty???.....shame on you!!!!!..\\n\\nno way these kids did this. the investigation was fucked from the beginning. the bible belt town was just scared of a few kids who were different and didn\\'t conform to their small minds. so glad they were finally set free and someday i hope they are exonerated.\\n@Samaflame Do what,more info please!\\napparently this isnt real. everyones actors or something.\\nI saw the 3rd one on HBO..It was good to see them get out..It\\'s like a trilogy\\n@APBGrrl Don\\'t forget Terry Hobbs the other step father who it seems to me may be the most likely suspect. He can\\'t account for where he was during the time of the murders and says he never saw the boys that day when in fact a neighbor says she saw Terry Hobbs with the boys in front of his house around 6:15\\n@APBGrrl u THOUGHT lol. what is your thought based on ? a biased hbo documentary ?\\n\\nthere wasn\\'t evidence in the casey anthony trial either. do you think she was innocent too ?\\n\\nof course nichols and baldwin could have killed them, no question.\\nWelcome to America! The only land, where can be spilled a creeks of blood in movies, idiotic so-called rapper ,,musicians\" films clips video clips with topless bitches and this everything is considered normal.\\nBut a few innocent boys are prison sentenced for a few decades because of being metal fans...?\\nHail to the american justice! Hail to american democracy and jurisdiction!\\n@MrPa1310 ahahahhhaaah . .  .hail Satan dude! He\\'s going to getcha. What a joke as you are mate\\n\\n@bathtownship You can say that again.\\n\\nThe West Memphis Police department back then was made up of guys that never had enough credits to graduate High School,lol.\\nProhibited from kids so they can only watch How to Raise a Street Smart Child.\\nThese three boys were released back in August. What surprises me the most is that the prosecution (police) don\\'t care about finding the truth, only for a conviction of these three young men and these police officers are supposed to be the \"good guys\", the ones that stand for justice...\\n@MrPa1310   hey winey ass..IF ya bothered to REASEARCH ya woulda known that THERE WAS NO SATANIC RITUAL ...NOW about that counciling for hatred against the \" white man \"  lol  ..get to it. Stop hatein..Life is good\\n@MrPa1310  shut up.. winey ass baby scum..you know NOTHING OF THIS CASE ..They\\'re  free and now maybe get some counciling for your pent up ANGER AGAINST the white man ..lol...idiot  grow the fuck up.You live in THIS  century not LAST. HAHAHA    OUT OF JAIL AND INNOCENT !\\nIncredible amount of circumstantial evidence pointing at one John Mark Byers, stepfather of victim Christopher.  When looked at together I would have thought this evidence would be corroborative enough to put before a jury with an excellent chance of conviction. Byer\\'s has changed his story many times from threatening the three originally accused to eventually supporting them. I would also love to know the circumstances surrounding Christopher\\'s mother\\'s death, I\\'m certain Byers knows about it.\\nThese boys were convicted by attorneys trying to make themselves look good. Based on what clothing they wore and their inexperience with the justice system caused their conviction. I feel like someone needs to look at Christopher\\'s stepdad a lot deeper cause it is plain to see that he is hiding something. They are now free but who is going to go after the real killer of these precious boys...\\n@DMtx1017  I realize that in the videos Terry Hobbs looked like he had no real emotions... he looked empty inside... and here I was thinking it was John Mark Byers because he was beyond pissed in almost every scene.\\n@LolCaramelz\\nMetallica - Call of Ktulu\\n@joemcpa you ar e an idiot and a liar. NO ONE who has ever read the entire case files belives anything other than the innocence of the WM#. P.S. - The parents of the dead kids think they got the wrong guys now. They are FREE!!!!\\n\\ndamien looks like seth macfarlane lol\\nI have no doubt, having read just about everything, that the wm3 killed these kids. The biggest issue is where. No substancial blood or other evidence at the ditch site. All bodies and clothing in the water. Were the children killed here ? Ild like to see the wm3 site founders use Echols as a baby sitter.\\nDamn you people that still say they are guilty-- what kind of EVIDENCE is there?  Blood? Hair?  What?  I really thought it was Byers that did it or had something to do with it.  Anyways-- we know that looking different and being different can/will bring prejudice towards you... what a shame.   I am so happy they are free (although they had to take the Alford plea)\\nWow so that\\'s how stupid the system can be? Amazing...\\nFucking inbreds!\\nI couldn\\'t help but to laugh at all these people. I thought I was watching Gummo 2.\\n@bathtownship thank god it happewned at last....fuck the cops and the judge!!!!!!!!!!\\nThe West Memphis Three have recently been released following an appeal.

Memphis AR is one backwards town!! Ignorance is very high there. If not, Damien, Jessie and Jason would have never been thrown in prison.\\n@taintedserenity69 Not true. I\\'m in Cleve. Wearing black has nothing to do with it. Teens hanging around Coventry have been causing trouble one night it was so bad that the shops had to close because they acted up. This is the reason for the 6pm curfew at Coventry and Cedar and Lee. I wear black about every other day, I wore all black today and was on Coventry.\\nAbout time justice was served, shame on the Arkansas supreme court.\\n@bathtownship ...ask and ye shall receive. they were freed August 19th\\nRead the transcripts of the court case instead of watching movies and worshipping your sicko fake friends.  There are multiple Eye Witness accounts of Echols and Baldwin confessing.  GE, Time Warner, Viacom and Fox are protecting their brand, they don\\'t want to be held accountable for the content they produce.  Do you realize how much money the music and movie industires have pumped into leaning on the poor little town of West Memphis?  Money buys our justice system. HELLO!\\nImaStonesFan is a somewhat fitting name, he has a stone for a brain, that\\'s for sure, hard to let any knowledge seep in there. You are so sure of your limited and WRONG information, that you are putting your ego before the truth. Which happens so much, which is why these three boys (now men) wound up in jail, which is why we have a two-front war, which is why congress doubled the filibuster on our first black president, which is why wall street affects us when it shouldn\\'t. and why ppl r sheeple\\n@grobsean, finally! someone who knows what they\\'re talking about! It took me only an hour of research to get all the current facts straight, the level of ignorance on here astounds me, even though it shouldn\\'t.\\n@xyPERSON, And here is my problem with the \"logic\" you\\'re using. The three boys have an unsolved murder because no one continued investigating on the level (or even when they first started, that\\'s a FACT) of police involvement, beyond a few private investigations. They offically, closed the case when they condemned these boys on NO DNA EVIDENCE. And when NEW DNA EVIDENCE arrived? IT WAS NOT ONE OF THEIRS. Which means they had the DNA of the real killer, and they weren\\'t looking for him!\\n@imaStonesFan, no they didn\\'t! Only ONE confessed, and it was under EXTREMELY strange circumstances. This person also had PTSD from the event, was traumatized, and borderline mentally retarded. I know kids with severe learning disabilities who may \"sound normal\" to untrained morons like yourself. But GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT. YOU JACKASS. Do you even know the plea they entered in to get out? Do you? NO YOU DON\\'T! That\\'s why as you read and reply to this you\\'re looking it up, or not...(laziness)\\nIt is time to hold everyone accountable including the police, Judge, Jury and simply everyone involed. now it is simple economics not that the state really cares. no new trial. Save cost taking care of 3 less inmates. If they find the Jury was tampered with then the judge anyone involved should go to jail. just BS\\nOkay,so here in lies my problem with this entire tragic case. If these three are in fact innocent then they should be set free,but it seems like all of the support and effort and favor that people have been giving is going to them. Let us not forget there are three dead boys who had their lives torn away from them and to this day eighteen years later their murders have yet to be solved.\\n@imaStonesFan   HEY IDIOT ....hahahahahhaha now yr gonna say YOU know more than the people who released them..sorry but you are an idiot ..hahahahaha\\n18 years!  welcome home boys!\\n\\n\\n@imaStonesFan, lol no they didn\\'t you jackass. It must suck to be so wrong and to act like such a moron.\\n@imaStonesFan\\nHey smart guy. Did you hear the update on this case? lol\\n@imaStonesFan Then you would know how he kept getting things wrong in the confession.\\n@imaStonesFan Also since this crime was labeled a santanic cult ritual or whatever. It freaked everyone out because it was in the bible belt. So when you have someone like Damien, who was gothic at the time the police are gonna target him because they are to lazy to do their jobs. And also in cases with children you normally are supposed to look at family memebers and anyone close to the family which the police didn\\'t do\\n@imaStonesFan You do know that Jessie Miskelley was borderline retarded and basically operates like a 5 year old child, right? In the so called \"confession\" Jessie made several mistakes about time of the killings and what not. He was interrogated for like 12 or more hours and they basically said if he confessed  he could go home. Plus he didn\\'t have his father present. DNA found on one of the bodies points to Terry Hobbs and a friend of Terry\\'s. Plus a witness said everything she said was lie.\\n@blondekittyg They should do a retrial anyways or the judge is guilty of obstructing justice and face the possibility of being disbarred from practicing law.  I\\'m someone who respects those who enforce and practice the law but have no pity for those who deliberately betray it due to emotional demands for quick justice or boosting one\\'s own career.\\n@blondekittyg How about the investigators were afraid of losing face by admitting that they made many terrible mistakes.  Any nation\\'s justice system is prone to that, none are picture perfect.  It\\'s the justice systems that claims to be picture perfect you should be wary of...\\n@blondekittyg If the stepfather did, then he was either very smart or the investigators were very stupid.  Many murder victims are killed by close relatives but this may have been a case where no one would admit that.\\nthis movie is a piece of shit all of the evedence against these assholes was intentionally left out so they could make the almighty dollar out of dumbasses like wm3 supporters.\\n@WaggJohn already watched it  =) and what a fucked up situation to be in for these guys...\\n\\n@fagtronx3 Buy it\\n@MsTheCopa any chance you got a link i just stumbled upon it and am very interested..hit me up\\n\\nk so where can i watch this?\\nTERRY HOBBS KILL THEM BOYS IN COLD BLOOD.AND GOT AWAY WITH IT FOR 17 YEARS ,ITS TIME FOR JUSTICE AND THE TRUTH .AND THE ARRESTED OF TERRY HOBBS,GARY GITCHELL,MIKE ALLEN,OFFICER RIDGE,FOGLEMAN AND DAVI,S AND JUDGE BURRNETT,FOR CORRUPTION,UNREAL,ALL THESE PEOPLE SET THEM BOYS UP FOR MURDER,WHILE TERRY HOBBS WALKS FREE,WHAT A CORRUPT CASE,BURNETT STEP DOWN,WE ALL SEE WHAT YOUR DOING,YOU KEEP THIS CASE AFTER YOU RETIRED,WHY?

I also love how they used relatively real technology rather than making up some futuristic bullshit.  If you like this movie, you will probably love another great Redford movie called Three.Days.Of.The.Condor.1975\\nI enjoyed this movie! River was so funny when he was dancing lol!\\nThe trailer and the movie were both released in 1992, from when Universal was still awesome. It was a very good studio, until the mid-2000s, then it sadly went downhill...\\nOK then! \\xa0J F K still alive and a fake moon landing is part of the conversation in this movie? \\xa0WOW!... I`d say I`m going to have to watch this!\\nFuck the NSA :)\\nI really like this movie. It was scripted in a very exciting & most intriguing way which drew much of my attention.\\nWho would expect a trailer to be made from original film stock more than 15 years after the movies release? The base film stock is irrelevant when the viewing mediums weren\\'t able to keep up with the quality of the film.\\nDamn how did I miss this 90s classic \"security\" movie. Time to watch this.\\nSomehow the video trailer must have been upgraded to 480p because I\\'m sure I checked the quality before making the 360p comment\\nYou mean 480p.\\nNoooo that\\'s for sure. i am just saying that in general, just because a film is dated doesn\\'t necessarily imply poor quality. But yeah, not much you can with this one.\\nLe reddit armey!\\nBut not if the film or trailer is copied from a vhs...\\nIt\\'s not 1080 or 720, since this is a VHS version, which is only SD. The movie will be HQ because of the film stock, but this is an electric scanning with a low pixel per inch number.\\nI\\'m assuming you don\\'t know much about film-quality.  Lots of older films are \\'HD\\' because professional film stock is actually very high-quality.\\nsetec astronomy\\n\\nStill miss River Phoenix though....\\nIt\\'s HQ for a movie made in 1992. If you think differently I must assume you weren\\'t alive for much of the 90\\'s.\\nThis temp audio track is dreadful, especially considering how awesome the music in this movie is.\\nI\\'m guessing the \\'HQ\\' was in the title but the channel owner removed that but I\\'m not sure.\\nI know you\\'re comment was two years ago, but I just have to respond: did anyone ever say that this trailer was in high quality?\\nMy favorite movie...it is now 20 years old! How time has flown!\\nThe movie was pretty good, but the trailer is amazing.  Really, this has to be one of the two or three best movie trailers ever made.\\nThis is not a \\'HQ\\' trailer because the video stream is only 360p!\\nOne of the best computer/hacking movies ever made, probably THE best.

Super.\\nThe TV show Coupling(UK version) got me interested in this film.\\nAnother Classic Nicolas Roeg film\\nIf I were on my death bed and could only watch one more movie, it would be WalkAbout.\\nCan\\'t go wrong with Jenny Agutter. Hot stuff.\\nJenny... what a beauty\\nJennifer On My Mind...\\nHaving recently been devastatingly overwhelmed with the Barry-scored brilliance of Roeg\\'s \"Outback\" wonderment for the first time, it understandably had me obsessively delving into Agutter\\'s filmography with some degree of zeal. My mother had always fancied\\xa0\"The Railway Children\", which unfortunately, in respect to my late Mum, I have never seen. My exposure to Jenny\\'s body of work was limited to childhood television viewings of \"Logan\\'s Run\", until becoming wonderfully entranced with her shimmering filmic elegance during a theatrical screening of Landis\\' lycanthropic opus as a teenager. Other than James Salter\\'s\\xa0\"Three\", Nic Roeg\\'s \"Walkabout\" is without question, the only film that has residually left me with the same dazzling feeling of heightened electric melancholia as it climaxed. Without a doubt the most emotionally-resonant movie I have ever experienced...\\nWhile these movies are rarely made nowadays, I\\'d say Old Boy (2003) did a fairly good job. Also the work by Kim Ki-duk is worth mentioning since those are very humane stories. So if you want more resent movies with humane stuff going on, go check on Asia and especially South Korea\\nThe late sixties and seventies were the best times for cinema. It seemed more exciting and adventurous and took chances where modern movies are merely concerned with money and tapping into fixed demographics. Nicholas Roeg was a true visionary filmmaker with his fractured, non-linear style which becomes a cinematic jigsaw puzzle that the audience have to piece together. It is not a passive entertainment when seeing\\xa0 a Roeg film (although Walkabout is pretty straight forward) but it is a rewarding experience. Walkabout is stunningly beautiful, photographed by Roeg himself. He was a cinematographer who then became a director and has a very distinct visual eye. It is just worth watching for the lovely Jenny Aggutter. I do not know what this film was initially rated but there is quite a bit of nudity in it, but one never gets the sense that is sensationalistic or vulgar. One can draw many conclusions as to the films meaning which is always the mark of a great film that it\\'s interpretation is open to various analogies. Marriage and the lack of communication between men and women is a commong theme in Roeg films so that\\xa0 is my own interpretation, especially a rather sad end scene.\\nthe lad is pretty intense: oh you want water, let me just stick this wooden straw into the GROUND!!\\ni want to see this movie\\nlol funny editing. \"Water?\" -then down goes the club\\nWatched yesterday. It\\'s still in my mind and i think it will be for long time. What a masterpiece. Such a sad story.\\nEsta la dieron en HBO Olé hace 20 años, y aunque es de 20th Century Fox, nunca la volvieron a pasar en ningún canal.\\nNothing to do with CH. Walkabout is a masterpiece. CH is just stupid.\\nI remember this,a great picture but not for the faint hearted,wasn\\'t Jenny Agutter pretty.\\nGreat movie but definitely not for most\\nSure they are! They\\'re just overshadowed by Hollywood garbage.\\n\"No place for civilised man.\" Try saying that line in a movie today.\\nThis is my English Enrichment study\\nHis heart was broken by the whites shooting those animals and leaving their bodies without even taking the meat. The girl was nice to him. I\\'m not sure that Aborigine died either, since he was held under his arms by the tree fork under his armpits. I loved the Aborigines and old cars in the movie. Great scenery and Jenny was so young! Lots of animals were killed and eaten in this movie too! Peta would be mad!\\nYes it is,  but  I found it more esoteric and obscure.  Walkabout has a genuine story,  based on a Novel, and Roeg was  a long time Cinematographer  before directing films.\\nHis visuals  are profound and stunning.\\nI agree that this kind of film is not made very often, but would point you to Malick\\'s Tree of Life (2011) for powerful, beautiful visual poetry. It is not dead!\\nfuck england\\nI wonder what happen to movies nowadays,,,\\nBeautiful film with great performances and Jenny Agutter in a school uniform!

So deep and beautiful.\\nThanks for share\\n\\nit looked to me like someone shot the animals for example it may have been taken from real footage of those who shoot them for sport. i thought that was very sad\\n@Hugo411\\n\\nyes it was visually lovely but some parts left unanswered.

Terrific actors that have the ability to bring forth such truth; a truth that speaks to the pride and self importance people feel about their particular world; no matter how imagined and self made it is.  It also shows just how much ones perspective governs their reality.

I can see how this trailer makes you think this is like some CSI Miami bullshit, but it\\'s not. It\\'s actually a VERY intense movie relating to political power and not to cops or investigators.

The book was great! I even was able to correspond with Ms Nunnaly regarding the translation in order to clarify something I was working on! and then i saw her on \"How Scandinavian Crime Fiction Conquered The World\" coolness!\\nif ever a book was butchered by a movie, this is it.  mis-cast, mis-directed, and a missed opportunity. what a fucking shame. a great book by a great writer transformed into a waste of celluloid.\\nmy dog\\'s name is Smilla!xD\\n@smartcooky99 - You got Smilla\\'s personality well. She is also very intelligent, mature, yet maintaining a streak of her youth.\\n\\nI\\'ve yet to see the movie, but experience has taught me never to have high or perfect expectations when relating a film to a novel it was based off.\\nI agree with joeehzy, though I\\'m sure the movie probably gave the novel some justice(It does look like it stayed within the storyline of the book), I imagine Smilla with more Greenlandic/Inuit features. Yes, she grew up (schooled) in Denmark, but the book distinctly has her recalling her very young years with her mother (and i think she ran away 3x trying to get back to Greenland)  The boy Isaiah is almost perfectly cast.\\n@joehzy - On the contrary, I think Ormond was the perfect choice for the role. She plays the part of the short-tempered, impulsive Smilla Jaspersen very convincingly and skilfully. Also, her character isn\\'t just \"Greenlandic\" she\\'s half Danish and grew up in Denmark.\\nI love this movie\\nI just read the book a few months ago.. And I don\\'t like the choice of actors... Julia Ormond isn\\'t even greenlandic at all..\\ngreat book by the way and a wonderful movie!!!\\nI just finished reading the book today!\\n\\nI loved it!

Happy viewing and thanks again for the info.\\n@alfriendo2008 ... Found it! Cheers for that :) If you ever catch the BBC documentary Synth Britannia on YT it references Ballard (rare footage) and Anthony Burgess quite a lot on the influences of the early electronic bands of the late 70s.

Crash is ridiculous in every way. A destitute plot. Laughably outlandish. If the mannequins they chose to act in this film showed half as much emotion as they do skin, the audience may have an interrupted yawn or two. The movie spins its wheels as much as a movie about cars can. Summary: Undeveloped characters repeatedly crash cars and have disconnected sex in the wreckage.\\n@meanbrew ...

Honestly their was no way of her surviving I recreated her shooting for a film project ..I had the plastic bullet holes front & back and they put on the fake blood & it hit me she must of really been hurt emotionally and physically no deserves to go threw what she did :( . Have you heard about the book a physic released of her she contacted her after her death and she said \"She has forgiven Yolanda and she has moved on but still remains hurt of her betrayal\"\\n@ItsFlapJack it really sucks that she died. :(( i miss her!!!\\ni bet god gets pissed when people get to heaven and they\\'re like  \"God?! Omg Is this heaven? i cant believe thi... OMFG ITS SELENA!!!!!\"\\n@SkaterFreak98  yeah that the artery ! They stated that in the famous crime scene episode of Selena .\\nIf it hit her a little higher or lower she would of survived they said.\\n@ItsFlapJack it went through her Brachial artery i think.\\nGod, How Much I Miss Selena.\\nd\\'aww, THIS IS SHAY MITCHELL\\'S FAVOURITE MOVIE. so I thought I\\'d watch the trailer atleast.\\n@ItsFlapJack No I looked it up and it said the gunshot damaged her heart,lung and numerous arteries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@riachelsea   no it only damaged the artery the pumps the blood I forgot the name but that was the cause of death while she ran her blood literally was pumping out of her...She lost I believe a mile of blood\\n@ItsFlapJack  okay well thanks anyway.\\n@ItsFlapJack But the gunshot damaged her heart,lung and numerous arteries.\\n@sixchickflicks  I turn 16 tomorrow ^.^  everyone wished she was still her but everything happened for a reason and god wanted his Angel back shes probably singing for god\\'s angels :D NO need to thank me for the video I didn\\'t upload it .... jgarc07 did ^.^\\n@ItsFlapJack\\n\\ni barely turned 15 2day born in \\'96 after her death.thanks for the video.shes really good.i wish i had seen her in life though.i only have the movie now :((\\n@riachelsea They couldn\\'t do anything becuase she was running they were in shock like Selena ..If she survived she wouldn\\'t be brain dead the bullet only hit the artery that pumps your blood if she survived she would of lived how she was before they also say that it broke her collar bone :( im not sure if its true but if it  did and she survived she would probably need therapy to help her regain her hand motion.\\n@ItsFlapJack There was like 2 or 3 people who saw Selena & they didn\\'t do anything!! They didn\\'t try to help her or anything. Also,I read that if Selena would have survived she would\\'ve been brain dead or something like that.\\n@sixchickflicks  Watch this video of her she sounds better LIVE than on her cd\\'s in my opinion its almost the same but she sings it with more emotions :D\\n\\nwatch?v=LbzEgfCwzJU&feature=related\\n@sixchickflicks  Its close by not really have you ever seen her?? Shes way more prettier than Jlo search her up :D\\n@riachelsea  if she didn\\'t run her blood wouldn\\'t of pumped out of her chest  becuase when a person runs your blood starts pumping more you ever noticed if you run a mile without stopping you can feel your blood pumping hard. If someone was near by and took her in inside their room and helped stop the bleeding and called 911 she would of survived but no one was near by to help her she had to run to the motel lobby for help.But it is what it is shes gone and theirs nothing we could do about it :(\\n@ItsFlapJack Even if Selena didn\\'t run she still would\\'ve died because she died of blood lost. Her heart literally pumped the blood at through her chest. Either way Selena would\\'ve died. If the bullet would\\'ve been a centimeter higher or lower than should\\'ve survived but because the bullet went through her artery that lead her to bleed death.\\n@riachelsea  Abraham said he never fully trusted her they would argue and when he found out she was writing bad checks and stealing money he got furious and told Selena never see her again she is not a friend shes a criminal...Yolanda says she bought the gun for her safety she was afraid that Abraham was gonna hurt her but her plan was to kill his daughter to emotionally hurt Abraham. If Selena never ran she would of survived but if she didn\\'t run Yolanda would of shot her a second time sucks :(\\n@ItsFlapJack That\\'s not exactly true because Chris even said that there was a time where everyone did trust Yolanda and Abraham said that he has videos of Yolanda over at their house eating and everything. Abraham started not to like Yolanda in early \\'95 when he started getting letters from fans about the fan club & when he found out about Yolanda stealing money and everything.\\ndid selena look like that in real life???\\n@ariesflame85 ..No Yolanda did not kill Selena becuase she got fired...Yolanda and Abraham never got along they always fought and Abraham found out she was stealing money from the fan club and he fired her. Yalonda was mad so he got back at him by taking the one thing in his life that he loved, His daughter she was cold blooded and didn\\'t care who she hurt all she cared about was making money off of them.\\n@Bratzilla1993 Yup, yup. Deleted scenes.\\n@moviefreaki It\\'s a song called, \"On the Radio\" by the famous Donna Summer, one of Selena\\'s favorite singers. She sang a small portion of it in her disco medley sequence.

Irish tribes invaded Britain as well.\\nyes unfortunately the british are still in the north. This comment chain started months ago and I meant that if what 900 years ago no british troops came to Ireland and occupied the country then no one would have senselessly died  from an unnecessary occupation. Not the irish civilians, not the british troops, no one. We\\'d all be much happier.\\n\\nRead my comment again and you\\'ll find I said no such thing. You wrote that the British were the source of the conflict. I wrote that the British were still there but the conflict had ended. If the source of the conflict was the British then only British withdrawal would solve the conflict.  British withdrawal has not happened yet the conflict has ended. Thus your argument has been undermined!\\nSo what you\\'re saying is because theres no major conflict anymore it makes the deaths of thousands and thousands of irish people all throughout british occupation okay? yeah good man, good man\\nFighting against one of the worlds most developed nations with one of the best human rights records in the world. A nation which is merely attempting to protect the self-determinative rights of a protestant population (admittedly poorly) and fighting against a totalitarian regime, a regime that invaded your country and a regimev which commits genoicide against the populace and summarily executes the resistance fighters without trial. Yeah sure sounds the same.\\nWell the British are still in NI and the conflict has stopped. That kind of demolishes your argument!\\nhow come the last seconds of the music sound like the main theme from the rock?!?!\\nThe money Pitt and Ford were paid for this could have helped the irish people and had more of an affect than this film.\\nOh and the welsh are a mixture of celt english and celt irish to form the Welsh people.\\nWhat? Ireland is part of the British Isles, scots come from Ireland, numerous tribes in the east of Ireland emigrated there from wales, england and scotland. Britain is celtic and germanic. Ireland is celtic.\\n\\nThey are two lands tied together by elements of a common culture. Past English aggression caused some hate but the majority of those who live in Northern Ireland are pro-Union anyway....since they realise there is more to life than nationalism. Its culture\\naren\\'t the british foreign to Ireland?\\n\\n\"foreign\" good one\\nWho? the IRA?  How do you know what you would do if your country was under foreign invasion?\\nI hate the ending of this movie.  All of my favorite movies are either brad pitt or kevin Costner movies.  Real heart and soul.  As for portraying a terrorist organization.  Who are you talking about?  The IRA?  It would be difficult to know how one wold react if your country was occupied by foreign invaders.\\nAn accurate portray of Catholic savagery which prevails in Northern Ireland today. Excellent performance by Ford*\\nglorifying a terrorist organisation...coooool\\nI wasnt going all grammar nazi, just stating that the way you put the sentence was wrong not the actual spelling of it. Can\\'t blame them? seriously of course you can no excuse be it 1000 years ago or 15 years ago justifies invasion of a much smaller country with the intent to claim their resources? if they really needed to expand why nit invade france they are closer with more resources? oh yeah we are dirty fucking cowards who chose to attack smaller weaker nations.\\nDon\\'t go all grammar nazi on me now ok ;) Still this was an age where conquering countires was normal and certainly you can\\'t blame them for doing so because Ireland would have done the same to britts if they would\\'ve been strong enough.\\nIreland was taken by Britain for about 700 years before their full independence in 1932. There was some anti British feeling in Ireland for years mainly during and after the plantations. Extreme fanatics were a minority in Ireland that grew mainly after 1916. This was cos after the Easter rising all the leaders were executed and this was very harsh treatment and caused an upsurge of hatred for British people. When the British realised how unpopular martial law was they stopped it.\\nWOW. Look up a movie trailer and you\\'re all arguing over Irish history well not all is arguments but most.\\n\"got\" is the wrong way of putting it. More like occupied the country and oppresed its people for hundreds of years before thankfully being kicked out of most of the country in the 1920s. It was never theirs in the first place to get\\n\\nWow, I do hope that you know that GB got Ireland hundreds of years ago. I mean really have you ever taken a history class?\\nSo it seems that Ford and Pitt are screwing the same chick in this movie right?\\nWho\\'s been teaching you a botched history lesson, eh?\\nNo there\\'s a difference between imigrating for what ever reason you have and invading another country. The British invaded Ireland hundreds of years ago ,they didnt imigrate here to work and live of goverment benifits they stole irish peoples land.Every country has people imigrating to and from it theres nothing wrong with that. I\\'m not saying that people in the north should move to the uk mainland if Ireland was united again all i\\'m saying is that the north and south should be one country.\\nBritish occupiers shouldnt have been in Ireland in the first place. That is the source of this entire conflict. If the british hadn\\'t invaded\\nhere in Ireland there would never have been a need for the IRA or their methods.\\nryan wishcamper\\nIt\\'s safe to say that after this and Mickey The Pikey, that Brad Pitt cannot do British nor Irish accents very well, yet, he manages to entertain.\\nThe music in the end of the trailer sounds like its from The Rock...\\n1:44 I watched the entire movie I don\\'t remember seeing Frankie and Margaret in bed\\nso what your saying is \"Its their fault\". Id like to believe that, ya know but im an anthropologist, i study human behavior and i know geography. In this instance i will say it could have been handled better by both parties. What about Catalan leaving Spain, or Scotland leaving the UK? Things don\\'t stay dead forever, the culture and traditions don\\'t always die. Sometimes you have to make amends as im sure the IRA must in the end. But maybe down the road the Irish will unite in peace and harmony.\\nWell in this i disagree again, there was widespread support for the IRA during the early 1900\\'s as the Black and Tans (some of whom were Irish, but most of who just came back from WWI) were persecuting the civilians. The thing i like to look at with the IRA is their goal, their problem was the method to getting at it. HOWEVER if you exclude every instance in which the British govt was cruel and inhumane to the Irish then you have become another example of the patriotism gone awry. Bloody Sunday.\\nI also understand about the troops being there the peace needed to be kept, but understand this there is too much hostility. What it comes down to is a need for civil organization and cooperation, im just saying that when the British govt wouldn\\'t listen because of their religious affiliation the people acted. That is what the IRA did. Again no excuses for the murder of civilians and all deaths are tragedies, but then so were the genocides as previously shown.\\nI understand that, and i understand that they want to be British as is their right, but you have to understand that it is an island called Ireland. NOT britain. If there are religious differences that need to be resolved let the people decide. I just feel wary about the influence that British govt has on the Irish in the North. AND i find more data supporting a united Ireland in the future rather than a united Britain. 2014 Scotland maybe free. Btw i love the english and welsh, scots and irish\\nle and not subject to the racist nature of their sometimes intolerant govt. Now have the IRA done horrible shit? Yes. But there WERE troops in IRELAND. As that is the country\\'s name! Let the Irish sort it out, its not britains ITS THEIRS! And btw anti protestant laws usually occurred in Germany and France not in Ireland btw. The British allowed the potatoe famine to occur because they kept the ports open. Thousand more died bc they were catholic and don\\'t tell me they didn\\'t.\\ni remember something a family member told me about Irish and Nazis and Churchill, see the irish were starting to support the germans and the English found out and called it a disgrace and horrible affront to liberty, but the Irish said \"we would do anything to get back the millions and get justice for the live we\\'ve lost\" honestly can you blame the irish for being sore at the English GOVT. Thats where the blame is put as it rightly should be. I have no issue with the people as they are just peop\\nis the nearest thing on paper in the English domestic record, to a program of state-sanctioned and systematic ethnic cleansing of another people. The fact that it did not include \\'total\\' genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, however, says less about the lethal determination of the English and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state.\"\\nMark Levene, 2005, Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State, I.B. Tauris: London: \"[The Act of Settlement of Ireland]\\n\"Faced with the prospect of an Irish alliance with Charles II, Cromwell carried out a series of massacres to subdue the Irish. Then, once Cromwell had returned to England, the English Commissary, General Henry Ireton, adopted a deliberate policy of crop burning and starvation, which was responsible for the majority of an estimated 600,000 deaths out of a total Irish population of 1,400,000.\"\\n\\n^ The curse of Cromwell, BBC\\n^ List of persons who suffered losses in the Rebellion of 1798.

A technique is developed to estimate the age-specific mortality level during the Famine and the number of Famine-related deaths.\\nDemography (official journal of the Population Association of America), Vol. 23, No. 4 (Nov., 1986), pp. 543–562. Fertility Trends, Excess Mortality, and the Great Irish Famine – Phelim P. Boyle, Cormac O Grada.\\n\\noh right and the anti catholic laws and the Irish Potato Famine. Ireland has been under the subjugation of another nation for over 600 years and only when they stood up for themselves did they gain independence. Listen i understand why you feel the IRA is a terrorist organization and that is fair, but let me ask you something if Britain left them alone soldiers and all what would happen. Oh wait that is what has happened and there has been peace, and I respect the British but the Irish = Awesome\\nI was talking about the old IRA, and the English have just as much blood on their hands. In this conflict many are to BLAME. BUT i do not condone terrorism, unless your talking about guerrilla tactics from the old days not the use of mines which can be terrible for all. I am an Irish American i can trace myself back through both families and my grandma was 100% Irish. So maybe i like the IRA of the old and maybe i would love to see 1 whole ireland, and if you don\\'t like it you can Póg ma Thoin!\\nYour a stupid man Mr Burke\\nnah i try to live for an optimistic future\\nstop living in the past\\n\\nMy great Grandfather was in the IRA, it was a tragedy and continues to be the treatment of the irish by their neighbors. I wish them good luck and God speed \"Thar Toinn Do Rainig Chughainn\" GOD BLESS THE REPUBLIC!!!\\nGo watch the wind that shakes the barley\\nI would really have preferred that this film wasn\\'t made in the first place, it only appeals to stupid people who buy into commercialism so easily.\\n...good thriller\\nThis was a shit movie, it was a Hollywood exploitation of 30 awful years that my country had to endure, with no substance or history behind it whatsoever.\\nwhat you bloody bastards call \"terrorism \" is a true national liberation fight !\\nNow in Europe the liberation of occupied territories starts !\\nIRA will always be an example for  europeanPATRIOTS\\nLiam Neeson starred in the brilliant film about Michael Collins. The film has the same name ;P\\nWhy don\\'t they cast actual Irish actors like Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy??\\nHa, you are a joke. You think that the nations in the EU have any sort of national sovereignty?\\n\\n\"Their own sort of union that will support each other defensively and financially\". LAUGH, you mean like the United Kingdom?? Some fenian you are.\\nBy \"very religious\" you must mean \"very catholic\".... the catholic papacy being the force behind the European Union, the Irish are going to be brought into the EU whether they like it or not, kind of ironic how they spent so much time opposing Britain but their nationalism is going to be destroyed by mainland Europe and its pope. If the Celtic nations really wanted independence they would ally together against mainland Europe.\\nSatan the adversary and his disciples, the world empire of corruption. The jesuits and their illuminati.\\nYes, Ireland is ugly and lost, so I want to help them. My blood brethren must be brought to the truth instead of being constantly molestated, abused and used by the devil. Did the Holy Prophets not speak of the wickedness and sorrow of Israel, wishing that through exposing their sin they could bring them back to God and thus save them?\\nPerhaps it is because I am not an idiot and I know the history. The Irish have always been more then willing to make themselves idiotic pawns of the papacy, it truely is sad, I want to help the Irish people so I tell them the truth.\\nIts beautiful? Laugh, if you like places that always have dark clouds over them, looks disgusting, find me a picture of Ireland where it doesnt look like it is about to rain. The most prosperous part of Ireland was Protestant Ulster but the catholics had to go ruin that long ago because they were jealous.\\nBecause Ireland was a shithole.\\nActually I am an Irish-American.\\nHow is Ulster \"your country\"? Did it ever occur to you that the Ulster Scots have lived there for 500 years and that the majority of the citizens in Ulster dont want to be a part of the Irish Republic?\\nAwesome movie guys trust me give it a go\\n@WorshipInTruth Us? Greedy? You\\'re the ones who came to Ireland and took it all for yourselves, dipshit.\\nthe accents arent that bad hahahahahaha cant stop laughing!\\n@WorshipInTruth i wasnt aware monaghan cavan and donegal were part of the UK now\\n@keveydaking  Ulster is Protestant, Ulster is British, the taigs have the rest of Ireland. Dont be greedy.\\n@WorshipInTruth ulster is a province. Last time i checked cavan, monaghan and donegal werent british\\n@aidenmccloskey  You do realize that Roger Ebert is a die hard papist who hates Protestants right?? You are Ebert are both IRA lovers.\\nWho is to say that Ulster is to be under the dominion of the fenians? Why are the Northern Protestants not allowed self determination in yours eyes?? Ulster is a nation of its own.\\n@aidenmccloskey Of course you are.... and a supporter of terrorist organizations I see. And of course that is the only reason you had any conflict with the film, because it portrayed the IRA as being anything more malevolent than a fluffy bunny.\\n@aidenmccloskey   Guaranteed I know more about the troubles than yourself, and chances are that you are a braindead fenian. I win.\\n@aidenmccloskey  \"they should be able to impersonate an irish accent with precision\" ummm noo, you think somebody can properly learn an accent in a few months? You are an idiot. In what ways was the movie not accurate??\\n@aidenmccloskey   First of all it is an American film with American actors. Second of all, it isnt meant to be a political film....\\n@SkunkyAngry  Actually in this movie he was suppose to be Irish and his role was IRA soldier\\n@depeche609 If you think Valkyrie was a terrible movie just because they didn\\'t use accents, you\\'re pretty shallow when it comes to movies.\\n@EjvindDark Yes, his terrible Northern Irish accent is balanced out by his pikey accent in Snatch.\\ndidnt harrson shoot another ira member in another movie? lol\\nbrad pitt and harrison ford <3\\n365487 223 25 0 148\\nHarrison Ford and Brad Pitt star in this harrowing thriller about an IRA gunman who draws an American family into the crossfire of terrorism.

In his only starring performance to date, acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh inhabits both roles: Munson, onanistic corporate drone and speechwriter for New Age guru T. Azimuth Schwitters, and the swinging Korchek, Muzak enthusiast and lover to Munsons disenchanted wife. Meanwhile, mad exterminator and part-time celebrity prima donna Elmo Oxygen seduces local housewives in secret code and plots against Schwitters. Placing the onus squarely on the viewer (If you dont understand this film, its your fault and not ours), writer/director/editor/cameraman Soderbergh presents a deranged comedy of confused identity, doublespeak, and white-knuckled corporate intrigue, confirming his status as one of Americas most daring and unpredictable filmmakers.\\nPT2M16S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::623\\nI loved her so beautifully talent and beautiful.

Letterboxed & color contrasts were impeccably tuned and toned.\\nI found the video put out by Firstrites (a dollar-bin destined arm of Hollywood Video) release of this on video & was devastated by the pan and not even bothering to scan crap release they were satisfied to afford us. To them, I send a silent curse. Characters are off screen. Some fabulous shots are destroyed such as when (SPOILER alert) Ms. Shelly fires upon the bearded one, Brother Esau. Cinematographically speaking, the film is diminished  horrifically. Try watching Apocalypse, Now on your iPhone & you will a portion of my frustration. OK, so another distributor put Sudden Manhattan out a DVD version. I can\\'t remember the company who put it out because I dumped it almost as soon as I got it (Special Order, of course). I don\\'t think I got far enough to take a memorable note of its aspect because the color was so bleached out, it was obvious someone took the shortest cheapest route to transferring the imagery to digital. It was impossible to watch & I threw it out, depressed. I have kept my video copy, which shares the aspect of the above Youtube offering. This is really one of my all time favorite movies and it bugs me to no end that this is the best we have. And I know there is better. I have about ten minutes of proof from when I recorded it off cable, to remind myself to return to the movie from the beginning when I had the time. That was my mid-nineties method for earmarking shit on cable. Anyway, IF ANYONE KNOWS OR CAN ACQUIRE THIS MOST AMAZING FILM IN ITS INTENDED FORMAT AND ASPECT,  well, I\\'d just love you forever.

Nothing exists in isolation and acting as if it does is not only pointless but potentially dangerous because changing one piece without taking any thought for how it connects to the rest of the whole will create new problems elsewhere.  Solving all humanity\\'s problems sounds wonderful in theory but is not realistic because everyone is different and what one person experiences as good, another person regards as bad.  Even if we were miraculously able to solve all of humanity\\'s problems somehow, humanity (at least at this stage of our evolution) appears to need at least some degree of adversity or resistance in order to reach our potential -- and without problems, there is no adversity or resistance forcing us to grow.\\nA cool must watch show. just dont expect much of the special effects, It is a 1980 bbc show.\\nYep.

I read the book after I saw the movie. The movie did it justice. I own the DVD version that has an interview with Ursula K. LeGuin. The movie does the book justice. Great concept through an authors vision of how society behaves and those that want to fix it... Encourage you to see the movie and read the book. In either order.\\nI First saw this in high school I think 82? I feel in love with the song a little help from my friends.\\nSo aliens run hot dog stands. I bet they run the convenience stores too,\\nNice to see this again!  A couple of years before this was made, I had the pleasure of working as one of several dancers with Ed Emshwiller, the creator of the special effects.  A very interesting person, one of the earliest experimental videographers.  His career started with being an abstract expressionist action painter, and an illustrator for science fiction magazines.  He was extremely popular with authors because his illustrations always matched exactly what the stories said.  Then he started to do stop-motion animation of his paintings, then he started to superimpose live action on them.  Then he \"graduated\" to doing electronic manipulation of video imagery and (I think) finally digital manipulation.\\n\\nI had heard of him because he was one of two artists featured in a PBS special about experimental video, and I fell in love with his work.  (The other was Peter Campus, and I fell in love with his work too.)  So when a choreographer I knew had a project with Emshwiller, I jumped at the chance to be in it.  Unfortunately, the project was never completed.\\n\\nCheck out Emswhiller\\'s \"Self Trio\", a collaboration with the wonderful dancer Carolyn Carlson, who is an amazing improvisor -- especially in *this* film!  ;^)\\n\\nhttps://www.numeridanse.tv/en/dance-videotheque/self-trio\\nThey all turn into the Golden State Warriors\\nWhat an amazing concept for a film.

I think diversity is the problem. An advanced civilization would allow each race to exist and express themselves freely. Even if everyone was the same humans would find something to fight over. A region you were born in. Moon citizens vs Earth citizens ect. It\\'s strange to think conflict would only exist with races, it can be a conflict of ideologies as well.Their will never be a one size fits all civilization because someone would still feel oppressed. If the moon was terraformed and turned out better then the Earth but limited space people would fight to invade and live on the better planet.\\nTikkun Olam, a \"Dr. Frankenstein\" of dreams, moral virtues, collective effects on reality, etc. There\\'s a lot in Le Guin\\'s book.

Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \"the Tramp\" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death at age 88, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.\\n\\nChaplin\\'s childhood in London was defined by poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19 he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry, and made his first appearance in Keystone Studios\\'s Making a Living (1914). He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the world.\\nPT14M3S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::639\\nWatching end enjoying from European Union, Lithuania.\\nAm I the only one that gets the erge to turn up the volume on a silent movie?\\nCharley was still working on his Little Tramp persona.

In the late 1960\\'s he became well known with films showing grotesquely dressed up actors involved in little power-mad sexual games. Hysterics and cruelty are his regular topics. Susan Sontag called Zwartjes \\'the most important contemporary experimental film maker\\' Zwartjes made over fifty films. \\'Pentimento\\' (1979), \\'Living\\' (1971) and \\'Ín Extremo\\' (1981) seem to be his best known films.\\n\\nThis film is dominated by an icy blue. In a monumental building a group of scientists submit women to obscure and inhuman experiments, in which sexuality and cruelty constantly merge into one another. When the film was released, this horrifying game of power and powerlessness was condemned severely by a militant group of feminists. The criticism was undeserved. After all, \\'Pentimento\\' is an art-historical term for a hidden image underneath the actual image giving an indication of how the latter evolved to its current state. The film does not endorse the lopsided power relations in our world but actually challenges them.\\n\\nThese afflictions are created by the imagination of a Japanese surgeon. Perhaps there is a connection to the past as soldiers were involved in torture practices. Zwartjes invites us into his films world: war, concentration camps, authority, oppression, power lust, sex, torture. Yet the film does not comment on that world, but -- as Gerry Waller, in a review described in NRC Handelsblad -- is an instinctive expression of Zwartjes\\' experiences. Pentimento is a painting in which images in the film are exposed but where its truth lies is behind the images.\\nDVD Available at http://www.moskwood.nl/store/frans-zwartjes-the-great-cinema-magician-2dvd-p-384.html?language=en\\nPT1H12M\\nsd\\nMovieID::::650\\nAn American doctor gets caught in the middle of a revolution when he\\'s forced to operate on a South American dictator.\\nResolution: 720p\\n(C) This trailer is copyright the respective owner.\\nPT3M13S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::651\\nThe movie ripped from today\\'s headlines....\\nApparently, most critics of the time thought this was a terrific example of film noir. \\xa0It\\'s a good looking film, too. \\xa0It is fun and educational to look back on these cultural markers. \\xa0Thanks for uploading!\\n5765 26 1 0 3\\nCry of the City (trailer) - Out on BFI Blu-ray & DVD 22 August | BFI DVD\\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/subscribetotheBFI.\\n\\nA vivid depiction of life in New York’s Little Italy, Robert Siodmak’s fast-paced crime thriller anticipates the films of Martin Scorese and is released on BFI Blu-ray and DVD on 22 August\\n\\nPre-order your copy via BFI Shop: http://shop.bfi.org.uk/pre-order-cry-of-the-city.html?___SID=U#.V5s1oKL-6So\\n\\nWatch more on the BFI Player: http://player.bfi.org.uk/\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BFI\\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BritishFilmI...\\nFollow us on Google+: https://plus.google.com/+britishfilmi...\\nPT2M33S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::652\\n\"Chris Hanson is the Blade of pedophiles, hes kind of half-half, he knows their ways\" -Dave Attell\\nWonder what made Renee uncomfortable?

However, her daughter Aglaya gets terribly worried that her mother will fall to her death, and this fear becomes an everyday burden for her to bear. Yet one day - following the family tradition - she herself becomes \"The Woman with Hair of Steel\".\\n\\nThe story is about the members of a refugee family of circus artists, their enforced interdependence, their eventual break-up and the joy and curse of belonging together - all seen from the viewpoint of the young Aglaya.\\nPT2M3S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::654\\nWorst movie of 2014\\n77840 41 8 0 4\\nSubscribe to Voltage Pictures for all our latest releases: http://bit.ly/1kjjbOy\\n\\nAmerican thief, Simon Keller (Cusack), arrives in a foreign country in need of a getaway driver.

Many thanks!\\nWhen this movie was produced in 1936, the Soviet Union was at the height of the Great Purge, and a lot of innocent people were shot to death or sent to concentration camps. In spite of Stalin`s ruthless rule, this motion picture was very cheerful and sophisticated as if this film was made in Hollywood. The heroine was described as an American, and it implied that Russian moviegoers had a longing for American way of life at that time. However, just like other Soviet cinema, the end of this motion picture propagandized the superiority of the Soviet Union where people could lead a happy life irrespective of colors of skins.\\n17643 94 3 0 15\\n\\nPT1H28M35S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::662\\nHoly shit!

The Zhao General was played by a Korean too, but he spoke with a very Heavy Korean Accent.  I dunno, when I watched the film on DVD, it only had two languages, Mandarin and English.

In Israel, there is neither civil marriage nor civil divorce; only Orthodox rabbis can legalize a union or its dissolution, which is only possible with the husband’s full consent. Trapped in a loveless marriage, Viviane Amsalem has been applying for a divorce for three years, but her religiously devout husband Elisha (Simon Abkarian of CASINO ROYALE and PERSEPOLIS) continually refuses. His cold intransigence, Viviane’s determination to fight for her freedom, and the ambiguous role of the rabbinical judges shape a procedure where tragedy vies with absurdity and everything is brought out into the open for judgment.\\nPT1M47S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::679\\n3577 3 14 0 0\\nHigh Quality (480p) Video detailing the beginning and proceedings of the NSA mass surveillance program.

The title should be the Man who Played or Cheated Death.\\nThat lip rouge on Arliss is just too much.\\nArliss was such a great actor, but ugly and skeletal-looking: too old for this role; the 1922 version may be more believable.\\nAh, the movie which \"saved\" Bette\\'s  movie career!\\n3598 29 1 0 5\\nPurchase The Man Who Played God here: http://bit.ly/1xanNQ1\\n\\nJust one moment of courage is all it takes. Distraught after losing his hearing, renowned pianist Montgomery Royle teeters on his window ledge, high above Central Park. His manservant saves him, then hands him binoculars to view the world he nearly left. Royle reads the lips of a troubled young couple and realizes other people suffer - and that he has the resources to help them. As Royle, George Arliss reprises one of his best- known silent roles. He personally selected Bette Davis, whose career was stalled, to play his fiancee, more in awe of the older man than in love with him - and thus began her legendary career at Warner Bros. Forever grateful to Arliss, Davis was delighted to reteam with him the next year in The Working Man. Two more cast members also went on to Hollywood fame: a fresh-faced, uncredited Ray Milland as one of the people Royle aids, and soon-to~be gossip columnist Hedda Hopper as a Santa Barbara socialite.\\n------\\n1,500+ Rare films, TV movies, and series on DVD and Blu-ray direct from Warner Bros.

Things are not equal,nor have they ever been. They did not overlook anything. They never put much effort in to it. There was a Green river Task force. Information was given locally,and Nationally about the case.This was not done for the Sleeper case. I literally lived 2 blocks from some of the murders,and did not know there was a serial killer lurking about near where I lived. There was a difference made in the case based on economics,strata of society,and so called race. This is nothing new in the States. It is a ugly truth,and deep debt that America has sunk in to. In part because many think what you think. It could not possibly be true,because you never,witness,and or experience such discrimination. I am not just making things up. Police officers have told my friends and I. We would not have stopped you if you were not Black.\\nLook up: Missing White Woman syndrome\\nI don\\'t necessarily think the police overlooked this case because the victims were black, the green river killer murdered more women-more than the number confirmed , and also got away with it for decades, his victims were white.

It\\'s 1989, the Berlin wall is about to collapse, and the airwaves are full of the sounds of REM, The Cure and Jesus and Mary Chain. For 17-year-old Jarle, life is just about music and his ambition to create a great punk band. But when an intriguing new classmate (Yngve) arrives in school one day, he is forced to question his priorities, and deal with his burgeoning sexuality. Capturing the pure driving power of a youthful first love, this romantic drama is consistently fresh and charmingly honest.\\n\\nSince its inception in 2001, TLA Releasing has been devoted to providing the best in independent cinema for LGBT audiences.

But immediately upon returning to her familial hometown of Amman, Jordan for the wedding, the cracks in her seemingly perfect life begin to show.\\n\\nMay\\'s headstrong, born-again Christian mother Nadine (Hiam Abbass) disapproves of Ziad\\'s Muslim faith and is firm in her decision to not attend the ceremony. Her sisters Dalia (Alia Shawkat) and Yasmine (Nadine Malouf) revert to behaving like rebellious teenagers as their estranged father Edward (Bill Pullman) awkwardly attempts to make amends. Confronted with the wounds of her parent\\'s long-broken relationship, coupled with the unavoidable clash of old-world and modern values, May is lead to question the direction her life is taking. Her once carefully structured world appears to unravel as she grapples with her own truths in this fresh, exotic look at a woman caught in the crossroads between tradition and choice.\\nPT2M27S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::696\\n2209 8 1 0 0\\n\\nPT2M27S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::697\\nConstance Zimmer and Sara Foster are hot.\\nThis movie should be re-release in movie theaters worldwide.\\nThat was a true Goonies toilet moment\\nI saw the movie.

This indie gave Ray Romano a chance to do some acting he couldn\\'t do working with the big studios. Yes, Wes Bentley was another story and was highly problematical (there were demeanor issues). This movie was almost single handedly done by a good friend of mine, Geoffrey Haley. He wrote the story, did the screenplay, directed it and even did the steadycam work himself as well. I\\'m glad this film has had some success.\\ngreat movie. the ending was fantastic. cant wait to tell my friends about this!\\nI really enjoyed this. the big surprise for me was how goo Ray Romano was. great character to.

I\\'ve been a missionary before for the LDS. Whoever did this will someday pay for what he has done.\\nThis movie is like The Boy next door , played by JLo, but it is released first.. Love it ^^\\nthe boy next door , lol\\nPorqueria de pelicula no saben lo que hacen\\nMormon missionaries are Sooo not like this! This trailer was just dumb and shameful.

In fact, you know that car crashing sound with the distinctive glass shatter sound heard at 1:40 and 2:05? Well, while there are many car crashing/glass shatter sound effects everywhere, this particular one is a very unique ans special one! Why? Because that \"car crash/glass shatter\" sound effect is actually used as the primary car crash sound in the 1999 action driving video game \"Driver: You Are The Wheelman\". I have the PC Port, however. In fact, there\\'s PLENTY I can tell you about this sound byte! It was used in MANY car chase movies of the 70s and 80s. So far, the following is all the titles I\\'ve actually found it in:\\n1. Vanishing Point (1971)\\n2. M*A*S*H (1972-1983)\\n3. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)\\n4. The Last American Hero (1973)\\n5. The Seven-Ups (1973)(This film here)\\n6. 99 and 44/100% Dead (1974)(heard in trailer at least, I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the film itself or not)\\n7. The Towering Inferno (1974)\\n8. Race With The Devil (1975)\\n9. The French Connection II (1975)\\n10. The Kansas City Massacre (1975)\\n11. Cannonball (1976)\\n12. Gator (1976)\\n13. Silver Streak (1976)\\n14. Smokey & the Bandit (1977)(heard in trailer but NOT the final film)\\n15. The Driver (1978)\\n16. Hooper (1978)\\n17. The Hunter (1980)(heard in trailer at least, I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the film itself or not)\\n18. Eyewitness (1981)(heard in trailer but NOT the final film)\\n19. The Terminator (1984)(ONLY in the original mono mix)\\n20. Commando (1985).\\n21. Mischief (1985)\\n22. Jumpin\\' Jack Flash (1986)(heard in trailer at least, I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the film itself or not)\\n23. Maximum Overdrive (1986)(heard in trailer at least, I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the film itself or not)\\nOf these 23 titles, 15 of them (including The Seven-Ups (1973)) are 20th Century Fox productions, which is a good reason to believe that they created it. 10 of these titles (including The Seven-Ups (1973)) have this sound effects guy who went by the name of Theodore Soderberg in the sound effect credits, making me believe that it was his sound. However, considering that nobody bothers to claim ownership of the sound byte, I simply took it upon myself to not only adopt it for my own sound effects library, but also feel free to utilize it in my OWN movies, including my first full-length film, \"Return of the Black Thrasher: The Movie\" (2009)! I even have it as my default notification sound on my Android mobile phone! I swear to God that there\\'s no better car crash sound effect than the sound byte I speak of. Oh, even now, I\\'m STILL looking for this sound byte in other movies. BTW, I subscribed.\\nIsn\\'t it kind of a coincidence that Roy Scheider plays a NY cop here, and in Jaws Roy plays Brody.

Roy Schneider doesn\\'t get the credit he deserves, he made some big films.\\nRoy Scheider became a mega Hollywood star do to the success of THE SEVEN-UPS. The movie that would bring him star power status and clout would come in 1975 with the phenomenon JAWS that cemented his status as one of Hollywood\\'s top action box-office stars.\\nTHE SEVEN-UPS was one of the great crime drama movies that were all over the place during the early-1970\\'s. Upon its release,it was a runaway box-office hit becoming one of the top ten highest grossing films of 1973. A spectacle that is ranked right up there with \"Serpico\", \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\", \"Badge 373\",\\n\"Across 110th Street\", and \"Mean Streets\" as one of the great cop thrillers and crime dramas that gave New York City its grimy gritty hardcore feel.\\n;;the guy you iced was a cop;; i love the 70s cars\\nI remember this and The Friends of Eddie Coyle\\nWow!

Hounded by his best friend Seth who thinks no \"10\" would even go out with a guy like Ricky unless she had ulterior motives (or needed glasses), Ricky starts to get skeptical himself. Turns out, Danita confesses she\\'s actually married to a handsome affable crime novelist and former Rabbi, Ben Jacobs. Is Danita telling Ricky the truth when she says wants to leave her husband but fears for her life if she does?

Definitely a step in the right direction as far as emerging from the stereotypical films of the past. When does it come out?\\nI literally cannot stop watching this trailer.\\nLooks delightful.  Please get it the full length version to my eyeballs!  Best wishes!\\nListen to yrself , WHY would a movie set in Africa have whites in it? Whites make up roughly 11% of the worlds population and less than 0.1% of Kenyas population. So why should they be represented in a movie set in a black african country?  According to yr argument Slumdog Millionaire (which btw is set in India ) is racist too cos there are only Indians in it.\\nDreams and the sacrifice we choose to take, or not.\\n\\nI got to watch Pumzi a few days back. it is  a  relevant, thought provoking and certainly entertaining story from Wanuri Kahiu.\\n\\nExpressive acting, well delivered cinematography and effects by the production team.\\n\\nCurrently in much of the Third World clean water and energy are for the privileged. Predictions that water scarcity will be behind wars to come.\\n\\nLooking forward to more.\\nI could say the same thing about 90% of the movies made in hollywood... why are there barely any black people in them? Is that a fair representation of the American population... think before u speak idiot, plus the movie is set in AFRICA!!!

But American Indians have no citizenship, no property rights. The courts, despite the efforts of Lance’s attorney (Paula Raymond), offer no remedy. Lance and his people must fight to keep their land. Devil’s Doorway, the first of the dozen or so groundbreaking Westerns by filmmaker Anthony Mann (Winchester ’73), is one of the earliest films sympathetic to Native Americans, standing alongside the same year’s Broken Arrow.

There some funny breathing fire from Drake... Sound likes.. Fart Fire Mode!\\nMUST SEE IT!\\nIn my personal opinion. You have terrible taste in movie my friend, clearly if you choose this movie over the first then you need a great big slap to the face why? Mother-fucking Sean Connery that\\'s why.

Crisp In Hell, (Ion, G Lover...... HHhhmmmn)???!!?? JUST SAYING, I mean am I REALLY/TRULY/HONESTLY the only one who finds him creepy as fuck!!??!? I remember watching him in Back to the future when I was like 8/9 maybe 10 and being genuinely creep\\'d the fuck out by him, and just wasn\\'t really sure why. I mean, I was a kid, yet found his character seriously strange and basically just disliked the parts with him in it. Now I know why I was freaked out by him...... End of...... Still, I do love the different, the eccentric and the strange and it makes the world a more colourful one ...... Each to their own, live and let live (as long as your not hurting others that is!!!) Also, he literally NEVER AGES!!!!!! It\\'s fucking mental, and I saw him on the red carpet with a beautiful young lady(as he tends to only surround himself with young, stunningly beautiful young\\xa0women) And was also with his father who was also EXTREMELY strange, he was facially identical but much shorter in height. He looked a bit like Salvador\\xa0Dali with the moustache That\\'s all I got to say bout dat...... ; )\\xa0Sigh...... Head shake...... : ] : {\\nThis is fucking top he needs to do an album with Tom green\\nThis might be one of Glover\\'s best performances. It was enjoyable before I even realized it was based upon a real guy. Nothing beats Gary (the actual Beaver kid) but this still moves me emotionally. The part that bothers me is that Harris made not one but two subsequent films trying to recreate this once in a lifetime thing. However, it doesn\\'t bother me as much as it use to because nothing beats the real guy that inspired all of this. Just an intensely earnest guy obsessed with Olivia Newton John & put everything into impersonating her. He didn\\'t have it down to a t, he wasn\\'t a drag performer he was an impersonator & so many seem to forget that aspect.\\nLove Crispin Glover!!!! This is awesome!\\nLove Crispin but hate the sexual undertone of his impersonation in this movie- in real life what made it so great was its innocence and NON sexuality....nobody was aghast at some perversion etc...he was just being funny and trying to do a good job. Not a knock on Crispin at all though...\\nI\\'m mesmerized. Entrapped and enthralled. There is love. There is pain. There is desire and but most of all there is misunderstanding. I\\'m there with you and I love you.\\nI was watching this, when my mom comes in... O_O what are yo- you know what I don\\'t even know *slowly  walks out\\nThis....this man....-passes out from nose bleed-\\nIt sounds like Dame Edna..\\nSurely I can\\'t be the ONLY person who thinks this is nothing but an awkward trainwreck... Maybe I\\'ve missed the point?\\nMmm... I love a man in drag, especially Crispin Glover. More men should do this. I think a lot of women like this, they just don\\'t  admit to it. Remember, the male bird always had the prettiest feathers. Also, in ancient Egypt make-up and jewerly was designed for men. Society has it all backwards. Men should be the feminine ones. Not women!\\nmmmmm, crispin hellion glover! drag, or not... i\\'d still do him!\\n@foxxxyrae I met him at one of his shows too! Isn\\'t he a sweetheart <3\\nhe is one ugly woman\\nThe original guy was indeed called Groovin\\' Gary, but both Crispin\\'s and Sean Penn\\'s character(s) were changed to \"Groovin\\' Larry\".\\nIt\\'s actually an impersonation of \"Groovin\\' Gary.\" (Not Larry)  R.I.P.\\nha reminds me of cedric from mars volta\\nThere\\'s that too...I guess we have similar(and peculiar) tastes as far as guys go...\\nI love Crispin.\\nKidonia-\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is it with all the guys I like are crazy as hell?\\nMore emotion than the real ONJ.\\nwhat is with all the guys I like and dressing in drag??\\ndo I smell a new Megadeth single?\\nin a perfect world this would get a Criterion-esque release...sorry to hear Gary is gone..the way the film starts, it\\'s an ok, what\\'s this about kinda thing, the two dramatizations really open it up and bring an amazing understanding of what is going on in the original and how bizarre, sad, triumphant it was...and yet so regular, great work Trent Harris, and the always great Crispin Glover.\\nOh... my... god... This made my life.\\nLMFAO\\nThe man who Crispin Glover portrayed passed away this week :(\\n\\nR.I.P.\\nCHG is fricking genius!\\nI got this on DVD!\\nI finally got this last weekend. It\\'s excellent. Sean Penn almost does Spicoli again.\\nOne of the best films I\\'ve seen. Really. Had to ask for it from behind the counter at Rocket Video in Hollywood. Works best as a trilogy featuring some of the early performances of soon to be stars. Trent Harris is an unknown genius. This film is an instant hit to whoever I show it to.\\nThe film is called The Beaver Trilogy by Trent Harris. You can email him about buying a boot for $25 at echocave(dot)net.\\nThis is an unreleased film, because it would be too expensive to get the rights to use the Olivia Newton John songs. I have seen the entire film as a bootleg video and it is mindblowing.\\nOmg!!

Prominently displayed outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, renowned and reclusive land artist Michael Heizer\\'s \"Levitated Mass\" gained worldwide recognition during its installation in 2012.  Over the course of 10 nights, a 340-ton solid granite boulder crawled through Southern California neighborhoods on a 294-foot-long, 206-wheeled trailer, drawing hundreds of camera crews and cell phone shooters alike to document its journey. Tens of thousands of people came out to watch the megalith travel through their communities to its final resting place over a 456-foot-long negative space formed by a concrete slot. \"Levitated Mass\" is one of the only pieces of art in recent history to inspire such a reaction in pop culture, bringing together the art community, public officials, and the general population to debate the merits and pitfalls of a giant stone suspended above their heads. The film takes on Heizer\\'s passion for this piece and masterfully interweaves this influential artist\\'s biography with the backstory of the art (originally conceptualized in 1968), the dreams of a major museum, and the uniting of a city, examining the perennial question: \"What is art?\"\\nPT1M55S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::774\\nWhat a fkn amazing movie\\nThis was delightfully surprising.

As her marriage and world begin to fall apart, she makes a desperate attempt to find the truth by planting a hidden camera in her home. What she discovers is both horrific and life altering and involves a dark secret about her neighbor Dale (Nathan Keyes) that is even more far-reaching than anyone could imagine.

Poor special effects. Overal good movie.....warm ending was refreshing ..too many zombie or outbreak movies have downer ..emo endings.\\nWatching now, not really a zombie movie. More like The Crazies. Worth a watch, wouldn\\'t buy it.\\nOh boy, looks like the \"zombies\" are covered in mud. Like MrFlix said, thanks to YIFY, I will gladly check this out.\\nThis movie wasn\\'t that bad, apart from the acting. I thought this until I saw the ending, it sucked balls, I mean, a zombie outbreak would be impossible to contain, realistically, with the strength and resistance to pain that the infected have, they would be powerful enough to spread worldwide within months, weeks even, but no, there just had to be a happy, inconclusive ending.\\nMovie trailer looks sick but its really poorly acted and some silly scripts were put in play. Also I don\\'t get the relationships were formed, it just felt like a rushed movie.\\n\\nThe guy friend in this movie isn\\'t a great actor at all too.\\nand do they??\\n\\nwhy are you so angry i looked at the trailer read the negative comments about the movie and still watched it and didn\\'t like it...you happened to like it and someone else didn\\'t and decide to vent about it on here just like the others makes u a critic just as much as me...the movie did have good camera work and seemed well put together based on the budget but it was boring anti climatic and none of the actors did a good job besides the main character...get over it\\n@ 2051526. I agree. It was entertaining and well done. I recommend it as well. This was a really good indie movie. The screen play, camera work, acting, editing, sound, cinematography, etc., were top notch. I\\'m a film maker myself. With my present skill set, I couldn\\'t have done a better job. I\\'m tired of all the back seat, YouTube, want-a-bee, movie critics. Don\\'t listen to those people guys. Watch movies and judge for yourselves. If you went to film school then maybe you can be a good critic.\\nI\\'m really tired of all of you back seat movie critics. Most of you want-a-bees only have negative things to say about every movie you see. I admit some movies really suck, but NOT THIS ONE. This was a really good indie movie. The screen play, camera work, acting, editing, sound, cinematography, etc., were top notch. I am a film maker myself, and with my present skill set, I couldn\\'t have done a better job. Why don\\'t you naysayers try making a movie? I\\'m sure if you did it would really suck!\\nI\\'m interested, but there\\'s so much variations of THE SAME low budget zombie movie (we\\'ve already have the VERY shallow \\'Walking Dead\\' series) that I rather wait for WORLD WAR Z to come out.\\n.\\nBeing 100% sincere: World War Z (despite being of a juvenile theme \\'zombies\\', show how different people in different countries react to EXTREME SITUATIONS in different levels, and for that I think is one of the top 10 books I\\'ve ever read -trolls fuckyou- ) THAT BOOK it\\'s actually really very interesting!\\n\"a legless chimpanzee with a crayon up its ass\" lmao!  Thumbs up.\\nWOW, this movie sucks more balls than Lindsay Lohan. Started off great, with a nice bit of suspense, probably \\'cos most of the actors weren\\'t sayin shit. As soon as they do, you\\'re slapped across the face with the realisation that the dialogue was created via a legless chimpanzee with a crayon up its ass. As is this wasn\\'t bad enough the movie can\\'t make up its fuckin mind what the infected should be, some growl like demons, (nice), others just yell like a kid needin a slap, and some CHAT!!! WTF\\nJust what the film world needed, another stupid low budget zombie movie.... EPIC MAYOR FAIL.\\nThe so called \"zombies\" were actually some dirty talentless people with red eyes (probably because of insomnia), who roared like they have eaten shit for breakfast.\\nI can\\'t find any other words to describe the complete shittyness of this wasted film.\\nJust stay the hell away.\\nLOL, came here because of YIFI\\nYour comment is invalid.

On a budget of 50k it\\'s very well made technically. It\\'s script is meh... There are a few laughs if you like that kind of humour. For me it relys on smut rather than sillyness for gags, and draws on inspiration from the \\'Jack-the-lad vs Loose-girl culture. For a Romcom it skirts the line of drama a little too much. In a nutshell it\\'s hit and miss. I too found the \\'twist\\' ambigous. I won\\'t kaibosh it anymore than that. Working in independent films myself film making at this level is very difficult and tiring. So all in all it\\'s a job well done for want of a better term.\\nDat ending tho\\nActually There is 2 Explanation For the Ending And 3 Potential Conclusion\\n\\n1.she cheated on him with jarvis\\n\\n2. Jarvis taught her that because she cheated on kyle with that guy she was talking about when she came acting drunk\\n\\nPotential Conclusion\\n\\na. Jarvis knew they both cheated on each other but he didnt want to ruin his friend life so he taught them both the same line\\n\\nb. Jarvis had sex with Lydia and when she asked him the same way kyle asked he taught her the line\\n\\nc. Lydia Cheated on kyle with that guy she was talking about and came to Jarvis to figure out something when kyle ask her so he taught her that line\\n\\nthe movie is amazing there is should be part 2 i just want to see how Jarvis is gonna explain that to his best mate,\\n\\nidea for part 2 maybe he will convenes kyle with something and they get married But at the end of part 2 she get exposed SOUND LIKE A GREAT IDEA FOR PART 2 :)\\njust watched it, wasnt bad, actually kind of enjoy it, will i rewatch it ? probably not and the best part of it is the end\\nguys...was wandering what you will going to do if you find out...your Gf,fiancee...cheated on you,without make any physical mess???\\nThe Trailer is actually much better than the actual movie.

Meanwhile the UK had non-rotating one-way HF radars. However, the Brits had the excellent filter center between the radars and the interceptors. That was why the USA DEW line and Air Defense Command looked just like it - it worked.\\nHistorically, this is very inaccurate. Ship-to-ship RDF was already operational long before all this thanks to Hülsmeyer in 1904. Hülsmeyer\\'s system didn\\'t give range, only bearing, but it was the clear forerunner of radar. Seven different countries then developed pulsed systems to give range too, all prior to the events in this film. Finally, it was Wilkins, not Watson-Watt, who came up with the idea of using radio to detect incoming aircraft. This was in response to Watson watt\\'s request for death-ray calculations. It was also Wilkins who worked out a neat way of calculating aircraft altitude based on his work on ionospheric radio propagation. Wilkins also designed and ran the Daventry experiment.

Das ist der schlechteste Film in der ganzen Filmgeschichte! Schade um den Euro der beim ausleihen verschwendet wurde. Omg bloß nicht ansehen das ist so eine Katastrophe ich dachte mir am Ende das kann nicht euer ernst sein! Und die Frechheit das er auch noch solange dauert. Der ganze Film ist sinnlos und besteht nur aus einer einzigen Szene!!!\\nhugely satisfying scene where the guy beats the fuck out of the thugs with candle stick holders cant save this turkey\\nI liked it alot. It\\'s not really a horror movie though. It\\'s more of a scary thriller.\\nHow was movie\\nIs this by a German director or something?\\nAlso jeder von uns könnte mit einen schlechten Fotohandy ein 100 mal besseren Film drehen. :D\\nSchlechtester Film den ich jemals gesehen habe !\\nVorallem diese Szene : A: (schmeißt die Kreditkarten auf den Boden)\\nB: Jetzt muss ich sie alle wieder aufheben.\\nBei der Stelle dachte ich nur an kleine Kinder bei einem Spielstreit -.-\\n\\neins wirft etwas um und das andere sagt darauf : \\'\\' jetzt kann ich das wieder aufräumen\\'\\'\\n\\nDer Film ist außerdem total unbedacht !!\\nEcht ich hab ihn mir angesehen weil die Geschichte relativ spannend klang und ich dachte es wäre mal ein guter Horrorfilm.Ich denke nur für sowas habe ich jetzt fast 2 Stunden meiner Lebenszeit aufgebraucht.Der Film ist verdammt schlecht und lässt einen ja fasst einschlafen. -.-\\nSo lieber Autor des Filmes...ich glaube sie haben ihren Beruf verfehlt !!!\\n\\n\\nits got a very sick story to it..in the context of a film...i think it was ok, just didn\\'t like some stuff in it\\nIS THIS GOOD GUYS X\\nDas war mit Abstand der schlechteste Film den ich je gesehen habe.

If u don\\'t have a life watch it!\\nSo let me get this straight: a vicious gang of knife wielding, axe waving, thieving rapists invade a home, brutalise the occupants, and then get beaten up by man armed with a candle stick?\\n@xRaggamuffinx1\\n\\n\"U.S.\" is utter shit.. go with the original austrian version..\\nbest movie i´ve ever seen top story... best actors i´ts so funny\\nrichtig hammer geil... der film geht knapp 2 stunden und ich muss sagen..... das war die schlechteste investierte zeit meines Lebens.

As for the racist stuff my race leaves on videos all I can say to that is its nothing to do with me and its not just whites that talk racist garbage either. Im no more responsible for trash that some white guy says than you are for the trash that some guy of your own race says.....responsibility is down to the individual.\\n\\n@KYMAMI The term \"ghetto rat\" can apply to anybody of any race, the fact that the \"ghetto rats\" in this film are black is incidental so don\\'t give me all that racist crap, and if your going to insult me at least type it in a coherent sentence you idiot.\\n\\nwhy does the trailer try make it look like a horror?\\nThey actually PAID people to \\'act\\' and camera men/women to film and caterers to pour the tea!!!!

I drive past that church and the pub they drank in (The Union Inn) all the time. Send shivers down my spine every time I visit home. Great movie\\nReminds me of Lovecraft\\nWhich place it is at 0:10\\nwait, this isnt the borderlands movie!\\nblair witch project but even worse\\nBad movie, bad representation of the Church, bad theology.\\nI just finished watching this movie. I am a fan of the found footage/hand held genre, when\\xa0it\\'s well done. And, this was well done.\\xa0It is a definite Must See!\\nWas it supposed to be a loose adaptation of Ramsey Campbell\\'s \\'The Church on High Street\\'? Because it\\'s awfully similar to that story.\\nGreat horror film, all the way througj, does need some imagination which I luckily have, does make me a little biased being British, almost in my top 10 horror films!\\nis it me just me or do i just keep thinking about how thats little john\\nSPOILER\\n\\nSo Mark where posessed, Deacon and the tech guy where sacrified, but what happened to the other priest, why did he had the eye stigma, where he also posessed  ?\\nsomeone remind me to watch  this\\nI just watched this...alone. Something really haunting about this movie. Claustrophobia, anxiety and heart palpitations are just some of what I experienced. This isn\\'t a fancy Hollywood movie. If you\\'re expecting something like P-Activity, move along.\\nthis movie scared the shit out of me. had to watch it without headphones\\nloved this film\\nloved this film\\nI hate trailers that don\\'t tell you what the film is fucking about\\nAnyone know the song at 0:43?\\nJust watched this film.\\nI did enjoy it.\\nIt really made me quite uncomfortable.\\nHighly surprised, thought it was not going to be any good.\\nI recommend this film.\\nYum yum ... burp\\nit was adecent movie, insanely better than the entire paranormal activity series, but it could have been better.\\nThis is the British version of paranormal activity and I think we did it better. British horror movies are the best!\\nI want to compare this to another found footage movie I watched recently, both high scores on rotten tomatoes, Willow Creek. Infact willow creek is higher, but both with lower audience scores. I don\\'t understand why the ending of this film is viewed good and original whilst people who have seen willow creek view that ending as crap. Personally I found the ending in willow creek just as good/bad as this movie. I wasn\\'t really expecting anything more from the endings in both movies. Anyway, I found Willow Creek to be more frightening mainly because the last half of the movie is a lot more suspenseful. The Borderlands is a bit overhyped.\\nCouldn\\'t even sit through this\\xa0terrifying trailer, sorry mean\\'t boring...\\nI found this pretty disturbing!\\nI enjoyed this movie and there were some scary moments ! I would recommend to watch it !!!\\nterrible movie dont waste ur time on it\\ngood film ... until after 2-3 times (there are much hidden secrets in this movie)\\nfuck found footage!\\n*yawns*, *rubs eyes*, *yawns*\\nterrible trailer for a good movie\\n...I just saw five minutes ago...amazing\\xa0the final in the stomach of the demon!...poor Deacon and Father Crellick R.I.P.\\nThis wasn\\'t a bad film, it does this kind of style a hell of a lot better than paranormal activity but that\\'s not saying much. However, does anyone have any kind of clue what the hell the thing was at the end? *SPOILER*................was it a giant stomach or something?\\nSurprisingly good\\nActually a pretty good movie. Fantastic camera work makes for some seriously tense moments and the acting is MOSTLY of fairly high quality (the guy who plays the priest just seems kinda cheesy. But-\\n\\nSPOILERS!\\n\\n-the ending was an absolute effing travesty. Yet another horror movie which uses the shitty \"Ho-ho! Everyone\\'s dead, we don\\'t have to tie up or resolve shit now!\" trope. Seriously, what\\'s with horror movies and crappy endings? It\\'s like eating a perfectly good meal only\\xa0to have the chef walk up to you and force a fistful of turd down your throat at the last second.\\nBest horror film I\\'ve seen in a long time. The ending will haunt you.\\nWhat a complete waste of my time. Typical British crap.\\nI watched  this  film  and it\\'s one  of  the  best  horror films I\\'ve  ever  seen!!\\n60fps a second spells death\\ncan anyone sum up to me what happend at the end? i watcher is and it appears there being digested alive, is there a defendant answer?\\nlame i thought this has something to do with the game borderlands\\nThe best found footage movie since the the spanish [REC]s\\nLoved this one and the ending was really horrifying and very original in concept. Creepy $#%\"%\"$& !\\njust watched it, it was a disappointment. don\\'t bother. i had to skip most parts as it was so stupid and boring, the end is the worst too..i have no clue how they ended up there and why and whats the point of that??\\nborder shit!\\nI\\'ve seen it all before... anyway, i\\'ll watch this movie. Come on! \\xa0For those who complain about everything: It\\'s just a movie...\\nWhat is it with these Horrible horror movies recently... Seems like everything is being done from head cams, blair witch bullshit.. this movie sucks\\nive just watched this on movie 25 WOW avery creepy and original found footage film i will defo watch again. I recomend this film two thumbs up\\nCan anyone explain the ending to me? Those two guys just start melting in a tunnel it doesn\\'t make sense?\\nIts a fucking good fuckin film\\nYet another trailer that totally spoils the ending. I\\'m glad I\\'ve seen the movie before watching the trailer. Great Lovecraftian horror\\nI watched this last night. Very good film with an ending that will stay with you for a long time\\nSPOILERS..................\\nCan anyone explain to me the ending of this film? Ok so they get trapped and what looks like acid begins to eat away at them, fine. Although what caused all of that to happen? Demons or just a natural occurrence in the hill. What is it that the film is trying to make you believe?\\nloved this film, the ending was very inventive. Although, if those of you are looking for a more authentic take on the documentary style horror, I highly recommend Lake Mungo.\\nThis movie totally sucked! It wasn\\'t scary at all and the ending was stupid. Don\\'t waste your time watching. The Blair Witch Project was scarier than this crap!\\nI watched this film. The characters are good and the film is generally good up until the ending. Not going to spoil it however it is really disappointing and ruined the whole film for me.\\nThe ending was down right stupid........ i dont want to give it away but why is there a acidic fleshy stomach involved.... ?????...\\nThe \\xa0ending scene was a real punch! Fuckin creepy man!\\nalways good to watch\\nfound footage always = TRASH waste of time\\nAlright enough, with two great leads. But the material and script they\\'re given to work with is shocking. The premise is tired, and every single line of dialogue exists purely as exposition. The church in the film is indeed atmospheric, but it\\'s abundantly obvious that the story was written around the locale and it\\'s admittedly awesome crypt. One eerie scene in the beginning shows promise, however it\\'s quickly squandered with unnecessary exposition and elaboration on every single event in the film. You don\\'t get to see ANY of the horror, but by hell you\\'ll know exactly what it is, where it comes from, and so forth.\\n\\nCinematography is great, with some moody shots and nice lighting. But there are many continuity errors in the head camera shots that really stick out. Lots of questions are raised in regards to Faith versus Fact, but nothing suggests that these questions exist in the movie for any other reason than to further the plot. I really wanted to like this one, and flaws and all, I enjoyed the first half somewhat. Then it gets ridiculous. Good vs Evil; etc...\\n\\n...stop me if you\\'ve heard this before...\\n\\nWhen one of the characters says \"..yeah, I know - I\\'ve read \\'The da Vinci Code\\'...\" he took the words right out of my mouth.\\n\\nYou can see the effort everyone involved in the creation of this went to, which makes the end result all the more heartbreaking. Not a patch on similar high-concept, low budget flicks such as \\'The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill\\'. I\\'m not one to usually criticize anything too harshly, because I understand the effort and love that goes into indie productions, but by the end of the movie, I was so disappointed that I had to come on here and put this down.\\nI was expecting that movie to be more good but i see it as a Trashy movie indeed.and where were the cave that they went to it at the end? and where did they stuck?\\nDon\\'t watch this trailer. The final scenes of the film are are in here. Totally ruins it.\\nFlawed but still definitely worth a watch, a very enjoyable British film.\\nThe shittiest trailer I ever saw.\\nonly shit movie...boring and badly acted\\nWorst film I have ever seen!! I love a good horror/spooky film, this was neither! The only thing worse than the film was the annoying/rubbish actors!\\ndoes anybody know what they got stuck in ? at the end of the movie ?\\nI enjoy horror flicks like this but always wish there was a little more explanation to things other then a big build up and then fizzles out with the bizarre\\xa0death of all parties... sorry for the spoiler :)\\nThis film was a big let down...\\nIt looks watchable. I just found it today and wanted to check out the trailer first. We shall see...\\ni think i may of learnt my lesson from Blair witch and wont be watching this guff.....\\nWhat is the song in the trailer and who sings it?\\n\"Best horror film since blah blah\\' fuck off.

Set in 1870\\'s Tennessee, Exit Humanity is the legend of Edward Young\\'s horrific and dramatic journey through an unexplainable outbreak of the walking dead to lay to rest the most important thing in his life, his son\\'s ashes. The bleak post-Civil War era backdrop highlights the severe divide that the United States was facing, the disasters that arise when man tries to play God, and the true loss of hope that so many felt during this period in history.\\n\\n\\n\\nExit Humanity blends live action and classical animation to explore how when in situations of severe horror, we must find hope through the very fears that drive us. Starring horror icons Bill Moseley (Devil\\'s Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses), Dee Wallace (E.T., Cujo), Stephen McHattie (The Watchmen, 300), introducing new horror hero Mark Gibson, and Narrated by Brian Cox (Braveheart, The Bourne Identity), Exit Humanity is a zombie saga that tells the tale of the ultimate battle of good vs. evil.\\nPT2M19S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::799\\nDelia York from Omen IV is different than Regan Mcneal from The Exorcist.

I really wanted to see it because Joe Dallesandro was in it. But  I have  to say it\\'s a very stupid film. Three guys go around killing everyone they meet, everything is done in broad daylight but nobody stops them. There are witnesses to some of their killings, yet nobody can identify them because everyone is so stupid in this movie. But yeah, Joe was soooo hot, so whatever! He is the only reason i even bothered to watch this \"piece of art\".\\nThanks to rockandrollheart67 for posting this flic. Been searching for the original uncut version for years!\\nThis is the original uncut version! The new release through Amazon (region 2 only) is severely chopped up. Most of the violence is gone, which ruins the impact of the film! The version here has Greek subtitles (?) but it is in English.

He now joins their other mascot, a goat known as Corporal Short Round, and will be attending all events deemed necessary by his commander.\\n\\nThe 2nd Battalion, 2nd Field Artillery has had a mule mascot since the Army began recognizing them in the 1950s. They say it helps give them a change of pace and also helps them to honor their roots.\\n\\nIt was a day of celebration as Fort Sill welcomed the four-month-old donkey, now known as Big Deuce VII. Lieutenant Colonel Adam Cobb says these mascots go far beyond cheering on the sideline during a sport.\\n\\n\"Coming here and seeing the significance of Big Deuce and Short Round to this battalion has meant a lot. It means a lot to the soldiers and their roots as artillery men,\" Lt. Col. Cobb explained.\\n\\nThese roots include the old \"pack mule\"  The Mule\\'s conquest is amazingly fast: he defeats the Foundation and establishes the Union of Worlds after only five years. Then, just as suddenly, and seemingly randomly, he stops his advance and settles into a five-year period of consolidation. This is actually because the Mule fears the mysterious Second Foundation, which is rumoured to be capable of defeating a mentalic individual like himself. According to a hint given by Hari Seldon, the Second Foundation was founded at \"the opposite end of the galaxy\" from the First Foundation, which was itself founded on the distant galactic rim planet Terminus. However, the true location of the Second Foundation is a total mystery and popular sentiment is that it does not exist. Nevertheless, the Mule launches repeated expeditions in search of the Second Foundation during this period of consolidation.\\nCan\\'t believe I\\'ve not seen this, looks \"shit\" good! :)\\nHouseBound brought me here.\\nThis movie was superb\\nyes a true Aussie hero with 20 frangers of dope up his bum .....\\njust watching this trailer makes me want to take a dump\\nOne of the most disgusting films I\\'ve ever seen; 9/10.\\nTime for a stool\\nhe Mule is another one of the quirky and odd Australian movies that are released every year that involves characters who are way over the top . This the the story of a football player who is coerced into going to Thailand to bring back heroin inside his body and when he gets back he is hauled up in a hotel room by police who wait til the packages come out naturally.\\nI think this is supposed to be a black comedy but i don\\'t remember laughing once. The lead actor has a face you want to smack and there is only so much of his grimacing you can put up with. It\\'s obviously not a movie that takes itself too seriously but falls down due to casting problems.\\nIt\\'s not terrible but it\\'s not a film i could recommend either.\\n\\nSeems like the best movies nowadays are aussie or asian or indie. Hollywood is shit, it needs to be flushed.\\nthis movie smells the sheet.\\nThe only satisfying thing in this movie is the ending.\\nDon\\'t watch it after you have eaten! I think the film could\\xa0 be more realistic if the small parcels of drugs taken from his shit were brownish and not white!\\nprotagonist terrible waste of time\\ndecent movie but the end is shitty\\n@\"nKrkan\"\\xa0 <333\\nmost disgusting film ever. but that blonde tough\\nMr. Anderson\\nAn excellent movie with a great cast\\nFantastic movie.

You\\'re welcome. *[SPOILER]*\\n1:45 song name please? :)\\n1:38 to 1:42\\xa0 ohh my God I laugh so hard.\\nCmon man!

Agent Smith\\'s new job looks pretty shitty!\\nCome on Mr. Anderson we all know you\\'re hiding drugs for Morpheus! You must take a shit! It is inevitable!\\nIt looks like an intense thriller, but they threw in some comedy bits that made me laugh.\\nWhy wont this prick shit!!!\\nnow this looks different!..no bloody superheroes in it!\\nThis movie should be called \\'Constipation\\', because it hasn\\'t come out yet.\\nWhen producers run out of ideas for movies they decide to make a movie about a guy holding a shit\\nIs this a comedy orrrrr\\nStory of a man who refuses to poop. \\xa0Wow really getting desperate for ideas lol.\\nWHY WON\\'T THE PRICK SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nAgent Smith came back\\nSmith my hero.\\nHorrery Sheet\\nthis movie looks like its about crap\\n\\nBUMBUMCHHH\\nI WANT YOU TO POO, NOW!!!!\\nhttps://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/31220108\\nUse this link and get credits for downloading apps.

Why didn\\'t they just call it something else, like the Shittest Christmas Film This Year =P\\nYou know how this sequel might have been salvaged? If they made it a horror movie in the same vein as Halloween III, and called it: Jingle All the Way II: Season of the Bear. When each Harrison bear is purchased, the customer is given the special Harrison app for the kids\\' phones, saying that Harrison\\'s got a special message JUST for you. When the app is launched, the bear starts singing Harrison\\'s theme song... and then explodes, killing everyone within 30 feet. Larry the Cable Guy plays our hero, similar to Tom Atkins in Halloween III.

It had more than just Arnold Schwarzenegger on it and that one funny African American. It had action, adventure, suspense and it even had a superhero vs supervillan fight as the final scene 4 Pete\\'s sake! This sequel to J.A.T.W doesn\\'t come close to the original, not in the least. Even with 2 wrestlers from WWE! THE ORIGINAL HAD A STORY! THIS SEQUEL WON\\'T EVER BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL!\\nWell this looks horrible...\\nThis film is worse than home Alone 4\\nSo is this a remake or a sequel to the classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?\\nThe closest we have to a real \"Jingle All the Way\" sequel is \"A Christmas Story 2.\" It has the same director as the original, and similar humor and gags as the first film, and David Newman doing the music score.\\n0/10 needs more Booster.\\nI hate Larry The Cable Guy in every sequels! Leave first movie alone!\\nThis and A Christmas Story 2 should give whoever\\'s making the sequel to It\\'s A Wonder Life the message that making unwanted sequels to classic Christmas films is a worst idea ever known to Hollywood.\\nShort review: WHY\\n\\nLong version: Unnecessary sequel to an unnecessary movie from a company running out of ideas since \"Home Alone: The Holiday Heist\"\\nThe First One Was Way Better!\\nYou guys will make anything into a movie, won\\'t you.\\nSorry, but without Sinbad, I can\\'t watch this.\\nThe film is a timeless classic.\\nI liked Jingle all the Way!\\nWHERES ARNOLD?!\\nNever heard of jingle all the way 2 until now\\nWhy would they even try to create such abomination?\\nLooks like nostalgia critic has something to review!\\nI saw the name and got my hopes up. took less than 31 seconds to crush them...\\n.....................................................................................................................................REALLY????\\nJingle All The Way 1 was bad enough\\nWhy does this exists in the first place.\\ni\\'d rather a piece of shriveled coal than receive this as a christmas present.\\nThis doesn\\'t exist just like A Christmas Story 2 or Home Alone 4 and 5.

For the love of god WHY?!?!\\nso how does this relate to the original jingle all the way?\\nNo.. no,. noooooooo, nooooo.. uhhhh why???? \\xa0 Nooooooooo!\\nThis is going to be the best straight-to-video sequel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nLarry keep your work on stage and Santino... Just go do whatever you been doing for the past 4 years\\nThis is a sick world we\\'re living in! Sick people!\\nA pointless sequel for an originally pointless movie.\\xa0 Not wasting my money renting or buying this.\\nno cookies\\n\\n0/10 wouldnt watch trailer again\\nAs long as its a nice family movie,\\nCompared to Kirk Cameron\\'s Saving Christmas, this movie will be like Citizen Kane.\\nThis movie was good. Santino is pretty good as the straight man character.\\nLiterally first video i ever looked up on youtube to complain about. as jingle all the way being my fav. Childhood xmas movie, thi movie just looks plain out retarded...\\nThis is nothing but garbage,this is gonna be a disaster!\\nThis is going to be... THE WORST MOVIE EVEEEERRR\\nThis is more Deck The Halls 2 than it is Jingle All The Way 2 <watches A Charlie Brown Christmas and The Grinch [1966 version] for real Christmas movies>\\nCan we sue movie companies for defaming the image of its prequel? Because if that was a thing this movie would be arrested.\\nThis sequel won\\'t be the same without Schwarzenegger yelling at you for touching his cookies.\\nFinally, Larry the Cable guy had the guts to do what Arnold couldn\\'t\\nJust seen this great movie! It was awesome!!!!! My family and I loved it! Would watch it again!!!!\\nTwo unfunny people who are in a in needed sequel to a fun but bad film. Great idea Vince.\\njust watched it.... can the child be anymore obnoxious? i guess they wanted to copy the original where Jake Lloyd was Annoying...\\nI don\\'t know much about Larry the Cable Guy and whether he\\'s funny, but Jingle All the Way was funny BECAUSE Arnie was in it and he was at the peak of his acting career. Without even seeing a trailer it looks horrible\\nWhat does this have to do with the first movie at all? Why don\\'t they just name it \"Larry The Cable Guy\\'s Christmas\" instead of bullshitting us with this?\\nBulk-buy non-perishable supplies, batten down the hatches - civilization is over.\\nI just found out about this they are ruining my favorite Christmas movie\\nCouldn\\'t possibly be worse than Christmas Vacation 2.\\nOk this could top National Lampoons Christmas Vacation 2 and Home Alone 3/4 for most disappointing sequels (ok maybe not home alone 4)\\nThis looks awful. But the first one was awful too.

Gemma, as Montgomery Brown, plays the Odysseus / Ulysses role, returning from the civil war where he was presumed to have died, to find his house overrun by bandits and his wife engaged to one of the leaders, Paco Fuentes, played by the always devilish George Martin. In an attempt to discover if his wife, Hally, has remained faithful, he dyes his hair and takes on the disguise of a mestizo peasant, gradually gaining access to his old home and learning in the process that he has a daughter who is being used by Paco as a hold on Hally in order to make her compliant in his desire to marry her.

Bucharest, 1959: with anti-Semitism on the rise, a group of Jewish WWII resistance members, led by a police inspector (The Imitation Game’s Mark Strong) and an academic (Academy Award-nominee Vera Farmiga), reteam for an audacious act of political agitation. Posing as a movie crew, they hold up the Romanian National Bank by making it look like a film shoot.

She is a typical teenager: moody, rebellious, irreverent, and is also strikingly beautiful. But her life is the antithesis of normal. Abbie grew up in hospitals, cared for by her protective mother.  She then came into her own in honky tonks, selling merchandise for her father\\'s band. But just like any other 18 year-old, Abbie yearns for an identity of her own.  Butterfly Girl charts Abbie\\'s journey towards a new understanding of how she must balance her past with her future, her parents with her independence, and her disease with her desires.

Well, in 1967, maybe it WAS ahead of its time, at least back then.  By chance, I happened to remember the name of the film and knew the sound track was of a violin playing \\'Listen To The Mockingbird\".\\n\\nFond memories.\\n\\nJoe\\nOn December 31, 1989 at 11:25 P.M., WFUM-TV in Flint, Michigan, a PBS station, aired \"Fiddle-De-Dee\" as a short subject before signing off the air for the last time in the 80\\'s at 11:29 P.M. (a half-hour before the big ball dropped in New York City, signaling the start of the 90\\'s). Somehow, this seemed like an appropriate way to end an out-of-control decade, don\\'t you?\\n\\n(In my case, the 80\\'s seemed out-of-control in that my father - may he rest in peace - enjoyed carting my family and I around every 2 to 5 to 7 years, until 1985 when he developed cancer - sad - and then - even sadder - decided to move us all from our nice home in New Jersey to a shack out in the middle of nowhere in Michigan. Because of that, there was also the threat of not graduating from the university I attended in New Jersey and having to play the \"transfer game\" again, which was mercifully averted when I took out a student loan and I was therefore graduated from there in June 1986. Then there was the problem of getting my career started, etc., etc.\\n\\nThe bottom line? *Thank God it\\'s all history now!*)\\nhermosooo <3\\nWhich style of music is that?\\nlejos mi favorito <3\\n\\n23988 165 2 0 8\\nThe McLaren\\'s film most inspired by Len Lye\\'s \\'A Colour Box\\'\\nMusic: Eugène Desormaux, folk-fiddle.\\nPT3M23S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::855\\nPalme d’or à Cannes en 1955\\nThe Birdman credits was like a modern retelling of this.\\nThis is one film you cannot watch on a computer.

God I wish the show got picked up for another season.\\nSo bad, Charlie Hebdo is still worse...\\nspoilers in commets\\nI hated the new Battlestar Galactica. It was so immoral and twisted and the woman was there. I couldn\\'t watch it.\\nIn my opinion is boring because it is not a ship, is just a sociological experiment. So if you want to watch some space shit don\\'t waste your time and if I spoiled you blame yourself for reading comments :)\\nYou know, it is your right to be angry at a show, but not to spoil it.\\xa0 Out of Game of Thrones spoilers, is that it?\\xa0 I\\'m glad I watched it before reading these comments.\\ni though this mini series was gr8, Got off to a slow start, but picks up at the end. underated mini series\\nascension is brick building\\nWe want more episodes!!!\\nJust finished Ascension on Netflix... Very few shows have had me watching the whole series back to back. \\xa0Not even great shows like \"House of Cards.\"\\n\\nFor me, I just LOVED this series. \\xa0I expected sci-fi. \\xa0What I got was a total jumble of conspiracy, thriller, campy soap-opera sex drama, with some sci-fi making its way back in as the series progressed. \\xa0I don\\'t agree with the \"bad acting\" comments at all. I thought the acting was great! \\xa0It ranged from campy (a la the original Star Trek) to downright great with the conspiracy/thriller stuff. \\xa0The writing was just excellent as the twists and turns, for me, were very unpredictable and totally original.\\n\\nBy the final episode, it was a glorious mashup of all the various genres with some great... and I mean GREAT sci-fi cliffhangers! \\xa0No new season? \\xa0I hope that it finds a new life somewhere and soon because by the time it was done I was 110% hooked!\\n\\nGlad I didn\\'t read the comments here first. \\xa0Too many spoilers in the comments! Unbelievable some would do that whether they like the show or not.\\ngod dammit. cancelled with so many cliffhangers.\\nboring show, Ascension is not a ship, it is a sociological experiment, what a bunch of crap.\\nSo Caprica 6 has boarded the Ascension to destroy humanity once again. The Cylons are back.\\nThis is a great show\\nWow, the U. S. always love to be the center of attention, even after losing the space race they continue this bullshit of only them are capable of conquering space, the idea is very good, but the execution is bullshit.\\nBogus storyline. Cmon SyFy is this the best you could do? SMH, just another bullshit show.\\nThis movie is not what is seems to be. Watch it if you like Dystopias.\\nSOME GUY: There are Vipers among us.\\nCAPRICA SIX: You say the sweetest things.\\nEXT.

Looks good.\\xa0 Potential for intrigue, pretty racey and action.\\nOMG THE BLOND GIRL FROM BATTLESTAR GALACTICA :)\\nFinally after making the rookie mistake in 2009 Syfy is finally getting back in its game. I still can\\'t believe that they chose to get off the horse that was high end tv and a market they created with Battlestar Galactica and let other networks succeed in a market that they clearly had an advantage in and a loyal fanbase due to their bold moves in terms of entertainment that was seen when they were executing BSG, I\\'m glad they learned from their mistake and are once again getting things into gears with Ascention,12 monkeys, and the Expanse which i\\'m looking forwards to. Please \"Sci-fi\" don\\'t give up in the genre that is clearly your own, own it, execute, and rise to greater heights like you\\'ve shown us capable of with Stargate and BattleStar both of which were masterpieces and great enough to rival primetime tv such as HBO and the likes. True blood and Game of thrones were barely able to achieve a minor percentage of the greatness that is Stargate or BSG. This speaks volumes because with their large budgets and freedom they were still not on par with what Sci-fi has shown to be capable of, Please don\\'t disappoint your fanbase, speak with actions and show us what you are capable of as a network and as a visionary for future entertainment.  #Syfy \\xa0 #Ascention \\xa0 #BSG \\xa0 #Stargate \\xa0 #TheExpanse\\nS/O to Adam Jensen speaking throughout the first 15 seconds...\\nthat song is:\\nBook Chillak feat Esthero - Ready Or Not\\n\\nLet people know... ;)\\nMerece la pena verla. Buena serie.\\nCertainly hope we will see more of this, highly entertaining and it gets me really fascinated. Been so long since I watched a new and good sci-fi show, thank you so much for making it!\\nI am one of the people who like the thing however They need someone who know more about the universe. They should have more syfy instead of people in a tin can wonder what their choices are. If your in space and left in 1964 by now they should more about space and be able to apply it to their situation even if its 51 year later that they are now in. Otherwise all new series have to start some place and I guess theirs is as good a place. The snakes and the or bellows need to at less have an education of some type they did on the enterprise.\\nAs long as they keep the gay and feminist bullshit to a minimum, this could be a great show.\\nJust seen this tonight all I have to say is it had potential. I think that this plotline though aside from everyone dressing in early 60s attire has been done already.\\nI say reboot it! Only to have the ship actually in outerspace and no superpower girls who els is with me?!\\nWhat a great mini series this was! ......way better than I thought it would be, definitely meant for the conspiracy minded people.\\xa0 I hope they make a second series.\\nit looks good but is it good ? my fav two shows are the walking dead and games of thrones, should I add this one ?\\nIt was a space project watching \" lab\" rats, to see what they would do under different circumstances.It was never even in space. I really got into it, but it ended very badly. Pretty good cast though. Just sayin\\nguys i need a little help. where can i find the ending music? i just love that girl heavenly voice. but i cant find anywhere.\\nHope You can help me :)\\nWhat\\'s the name of that song??\\nit was good though\\nthe ending of this show was confusing\\nIn the episode 2 they say it\\'s marvelous 1 kill in 50 years, it\\'s 0.0057% of murders by years and by people.\\nIt\\'s less than in USA where it\\'s 0,0065%. And so y am happy to be French and live in France with only 0,0007% of murder by people.\\nwhat a terrible choice of music for a trailer.\\nWannabe the 100?\\nit actualy is a very good show\\nthe series is made out of a real story - project ORION , check it out ;) besides that it;s based on TRANSHUMANISM movement ,and Steven Hauking\\'s idea of spacetravel - starchild ideea\\nI actually liked this show. But i don\\'t think it will be made into a series though.\\nThe show is more about creating a super being than about travelling to another planet, even though one of them do end up on another planet.\\n\\n\\nThis show reminds me of the Pioneer One Web series except you have a secret American project here instead of of a Soviet space project.\\nThis is a true event. An event picked from the event Horizon. One of many possible realities......;-) ;-)\\nI have more hope for the characters on \"The Walking Dead\" as opposed to this show... its so poorly written that within the first hour even the actors are confused... Its as if the writers of FatalStart Fatlagica merged with the writers of that doomed series Star Gate Univrse, and made a new show... That nobody would like, because they forgot to write in a character that anyone might like.\\nI took a shit today it looked better than his trailer.\\nBig disappointment. I thought the SyFy channel was finely going back to what made it a great channel…… Good written SciFi. But no, they had to show a conspiracy\\xa0mini-series \\xa0with a murder plot. Im so done with them.\\nadam jensen madafaka\\nPourquoi, voir forcement l\\'avenir humain en sombre…\\nC\\'est un \"peu\" agaçant…\\nStar Trek, voilà un futur qui donne l\\'envie de vivre…\\nThis show ended up making no sense at all. Very disappointing.\\nNow that its out... watch the first episode. or if you don\\'t care... just the last 10 minutes. If nobody has already said this. IT\\'S NOTHING LIKE INTERSTELLAR!!! really not a single strand of the plot is the same... unless some man having a daughter belongs to interstellar ;)\\nSo Project Ascension is like the Vaults from Fallout...but in space, and keeping with the sixties theme too?

L.S.D figured hugely in the approach Laing took to Healing... and much else besides.\\nR.D Laing\\'s theories about the Family, in relation to those labeled Schizophrenic, are more complex and qualified than simply attacking the Family setup. Wider criticisms were cast over The Psychiatric Establishment itself, The Whole Military~Industrial Machine and other Control Systems wherever they are found to be detrimental to the open individuation that Laing maintained was necessary for the Emotional Wellbeing of most People. Laing was a Humanist who took an Existentialist approach to the Suffering and suppression of those Victimised by a Crazy Society.\\nWow, great film, still so relevant. 52 years later.\\nwho,s a good boy then ,was good\\nthe actress Sandy Ratcliff. who plated Kate , died today age 70 from a morphine overdose due to terminal lung condition\\nAlthough this is very good, it basically is putting forth, except for the ending, the popular psychiatric theory at the time of the \"schizophrenogenic mother,\" i.e. blaming the mother for this mental illness though it was entirely untrue and caused a lot of harm.  People still don\\'t understand it\\'s causes, though genetics play a part, but this blaming of the mother was so popular then for any kind of metnal illness often, but especially so with schizophrenia, to the point that the term \"schizophrenogenic mother\" was born.\\nI do believe her dad was in Grange Hill.\\nWow!\\nAll before: The England and Wales Mental Health Act (1983).\\nA different age, as apposed to today\\'s mental health treatment.\\nA different type of patient.\\n\"A \\'Tiny Tears\\' doll as a sleeping comfort..

Any person with learning difficulties, post natal depression and general burn out were classed as a basket case,  put in nuthouses and jolted with E.C.T. and kept against their will,  and it was not so long ago. Even Winston Churchill had an idea of England having a \"Master Race\" and wanted to get rid of the \"Weaklings\" and have them institutionalised.  All this is not my fabrication, IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT.\\nThe only sane people I\\'ve ever known were all a bit mad.\\nNot wanting to be mean but is the actress playing Kate just a\\nlittle old for the part ?\\nThis appears to be copy of a British movie Family Life, a very sad and controversial film. Both of these are based upon the theories of R D laing, a very controversial Scots psychiatrist. Basically he believed most mental illness, especially schizophrenia, were caused by family relationsips. It\\'s more complicated but that is the basic theory.\\nWhat is equally disturbing about this play, is the attitude from the girl\\'s parents, regarding their daughter\\'s mental illness: they simply can\\'t or won\\'t accept that she is very ill and needs support. The ending is quite sinister as well. An excellent play.\\nWould love to see \\'After A Lifetime\\' once more.

Within weeks, she is a criminal, the linchpin in a jewel heist. How she got there forms the twisted heart of this psychological crime thriller. The answer, of course, is a man: Leigh Hartley, a painter whose real talent may be his ability to manipulate a lonely young woman. He courts Deborah, making her feel whole and desirable. Now he has one favor to ask...and Deborah, despite claustrophobia from her time in an iron lung, hides in a closet so that she can slip out after the auction house\\'s closing to let her lover enter and steal a fortune in gems. Blending boyish charm with a threat of danger, David Hemmings (Blow-Up) makes a magnetic Leigh. And Roger Greenspun of The New York Times praises Samantha Eggar\\'s (The Collector) \"beautifully restrained and evocative performance\" as Deborah.\\n------\\n1,000+ Rare films, TV movies, and series on DVD direct from the Studio.\\nhttp://www.warnerarchive.com\\nPT2M10S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::887\\nThat picture with this music makes me think, what the movie has a hilarious shootout.

He and his girlfriend Janice (Christine Lahti) cruise the local casinos in search of new ways to outwit the security cameras, but in the meantime, Joe\\'s scams provide a steady source of income. Their comfortable lifestyle is disrupted when Yonkers Joe receives a call from the institution where his son, Joe Jr. (Tom Guiry), lives. Mentally challenged since birth, 21-year-old Joe has recently been displaying hostile and aggressive behavior toward his fellow students. As a result, he is being expelled from the institution and forced to move in with his father until new arrangements can be made.\\n\\n\\n\\nFaced with the prospect of caring for his son or paying for him to live in an expensive group home, Yonkers Joe begins to formulate a plan to execute the scam of his lifetime. With his winnings, he hopes to be able to take care of his son\\'s expenses for years to come. He, Janice, and Joe Jr. travel to Las Vegas, and what unfolds tests the bonds of their relationship but also brings them together in new and unexpected ways. Bolstered by terrific performances by Palminteri, Lahti, and Guiry, Yonkers Joe tells the heartwarming story of a father and son learning to appreciate one another for their strengths as well as their weaknesses. The casino scenes are fraught with suspense, but it is the compelling bond shared by the three lead characters that resonates long after the credits have rolled.\\nPT2M13S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::892\\nwhen the trailer become so much better then the movie it self\\nSomebody knows the song of this trailer?\\nCan\\'t wait to see this movie.\\nI love Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones, duh) and heard about this film.

Today there are effective medications to control those neurological impulses. Sadly, until the late 1950\\'s people actually died from epilepsy because the neurosciences weren\\'t there like they are today. I lost my grandfather to epilepsy at only 39 years of age. Diagnosis of epilepsy is much more common then most people realize & it is MIS-diagnosed  25-30% of the time in some countries.\\nSuch a wonderful wonderful production, a real insight into the Royal Family at that time.\\nEvery part of \\'The Lost Prince \\' is technically correct due entirely to the great Steven Poliakoff. Everyone should watch it - its great, I never tire of it. The actors in this are supreme!\\nWell said Johnny: make \\'em wait!\\n0:10 - johnny la hanta esta muy loca\\nRollo Weeks (Prince Georgie).

I\\'d been wondering what those melancholy music pieces were called and whom they were by.\\nThank you for posting this. Prince John\\'s recital is my favorite scene in this eloqent film. Such a poignant scene knowing Johnny\\'s fate. :(\\n@lalahammy Yes, it is funny how matter-of-fact he is about it. I wonder if it relates to the very first time the doctors assessed him, when Lala tried to get him to throw the ball to her and he didn\\'t respond. From his perspective, showing them all he could do that might seem just as significant as showing them his trumpet skills!\\nAlso....sorry about this guys.....Britain was a completely different country back then when illness was seen as a weakness. So the King and Queen wanted their Prince Son to be hidden from all - hence throughout the film they always tried to keep him away from the public. It was the constant stresses of all this making her cry and the fact that they just want to be left alone...which is why when this film came out it was so controversial...people drew paralells with Diana and William and Harry!\\nthe Russian Royals (Tsar Romanovs) were related directly to our Royals and the Russian Bolsheviks (communists) were having a revolution because they despised the Royal Family. They despised the Royals because they wanted the ordinary Russians to believe that the Royals did not care about ordinary Russians. The Bolsheviks made the royals out to be abusive and cruel - by all accounts was false. So it was the stress of all this which is making her cry! I believe anyway!\\n@lalahammy Its an emotional film. The young prince had a dibilitating illness which he was born with. many people today suffer from it. Basically at random points in time the person collapses into convulsions uncontrollable fits.  He was also the son of the ruling monarch who was about to send hundreds of thousand s of young men to battle in the 1st World war or rather trying to avert war. The Royals were not liked - much as the same in Russia -\\nThe King and Queen are such harsh disciplinarians. Shunning Johnnie was an unforgivable act and it was a crime to a farm to be lonely. RIP HRH The Prince John and anyone who helped his struggle with epilepsy\\n@RichardvsHimself, very sad\\nThats telling them!!!\\nThe reason that Queen Alexandra is crying is because all that she known and the people loved were now gone........her husband, King Edward VII was dead......her nephew, Emperor Nicholas II and his entire family..his wife and children..who were murdered in 1918......all the grandeur of monarchy was extinquished........\\n@laughtereveryday You\\'re welcome.

So, instead, if you do a youtube search for \"Ann Lemke - Oboe d-amore - \"Largo\" \" you\\'ll find a nice rendition by oboe of the same tune.\\nThe first trumpet piece played is indeed Viviani\\'s Second Sonata for Trumpet and Organ.

EXCEPT what is up with that Baphomet Insignia shown before each \"story\" that\\'s troubling.\\nFirst film was best of three short films; they certainly made good films in past.Modern film rely on C.G.I to make them watchable ????\\n....In short story after short story (“The Know All”; “The Pretender”; “Winter Cruise”), Somerset Maugham returns to the same theme, featuring the same character : the supposed “Know-It-All”; the “Bore”; the societal “Misfit”.... And—in each case—he illustrates that the “loudmouth” that everyone attempts to avoid , actually sees far more deeply into the human spirit than those that are mocking him ever could hope to....In almost heart-breaking simplicity, he illustrates how “The Bore” uses garrulousness to mask his/her own loneliness and insecurity—and yet, how this same supposedly “insensitive” individual is always the first to defend the dignity of others.......The fact that an individual of Maugham’s time and social class could see this human truth so clearly, illustrates not only a man who possessed a very deep understanding of human nature.....but a very big heart.....\\nAbsolutely delightful!!

Didn\\'t mention my favorite book by W. Somerset Maugham - - also made into a movie and released in 1945 - - \"OF HUMAN BONDAGE\".  Catch the movie if you can.  Of course,  the book is always better than the movie version.  So I advise that you DO READ THE BOOK!\\nby Fancy Nancy (again)\\nDecember 5, 2016\\nW. Somerset Maugham was a gifted writer of the nineteenth century.   I was entranced by his books in the middle of the 20th century.  Would read for hours until I would fall asleep back when my first child, my precious son, was a little boy and his dad, my husband, was in the U. S. Army overseas in Germany during the Korean Conflict.  Plaudits to such a marvelous inventor of mind-boggling stories!\\nby Fancy Nancy\\nDec. 5, 2016\\n7:49 AM\\nGreat! Thanks\\nAnother Somerset Maughan story well adapted to film was \\'The moon and sixpence\\' which has the added bonus of George Sanders.\\nI just adore this\\nI guess all she wanted was the  reassurance of his love.\\nI love old British movies....simply wonderful\\nThis is absolutely one of the best things I\\'ve seen lately. Completely captivating. Must see!\\nThese old movies are truly fantastic...thank you SO much!!!!!!!\\nVery enjoyable film!!\\nI agree, Cameron.  I can look at these oldies for hours at a time!\\nVery enjoyable, thanks\\nSomerset Maughan had a touch of genius.  His stories are quite simple, corny even but how  they describe life.   Beautifully acted by some  great British actors.  The ship\\'s crew was perfectly casted.  Englishman ,  Irishman,  Scotsman and  Frenchman (well not really). You might remember  John Laurie as the \"the dour Scot\"   in Dad\\'s Army.  Good to see him as a young man here.\\nI love old British films of this period, and some American ones. Why don\\'t they put some of these on TV instead of all those mediocre\\xa0modern ones?\\nIs rather watch 50 movies like this than 1 from today, I thought I hated movies but these are splendid\\nWhat a brilliant actor Nigel Patrick was.Would have loved to have known his reaction to the early sixties New Wave.\\nThe ladder scene is brilliant, thanks\\npretentious snobs, their way of talking makes one sick.\\nA lovely film, to transport one away from the ugly 21st century.\\nwhats this about?\\nThese shorts remind me of my local politician, he is tedious and boring too.\\nMy mother (a Canadian) worked for British Intelligence during WWII in the US. She had an extensive Maugham library that I would dip into from time to time growing up. I understood that what he wrote had implications but couldn\\'t figure out what they were!\\nDelightful film. Loved all three episodes, but the second one about Ms Reid is wonderful. What a treat, many thanks for sharing this beauty.\\nThanks for the upload:  a very good copy of a very good film ! Very good acting, and the different Directors are also either satisfactory or good. I didn\\'t know any of these stories by S. Maugham, so it was very rewarding.   Shared on Google+\\nWonderful movie and love the British\\nI recognized that voice instantly. The high diver is the childrens mother on Mary Poppins.\\nThere\\'s no flow. The film seems as an unrelated trilogy. Some old man, whom seems to take himself too seriously,\\xa0breaks in, interrupts the story\\xa0and talks about the fact that he apparently considers himself a writer. I believe his name is William something. I guess that\\'s the good ole British humor showing through.\\nahhhh the golden years.\\nMost families have someone like Nigel Patrick in them\\n2nd story re: middle-aged gabby woman that nobody likes. Seems to me that taken in small doses she\\'d be quite sweet. So a tea shop is the perfect business for her.\\nthe dialog and acting in Winter Cruise was superb ..I really enjoyed this thanks so much\\nIf there is a second prize for voices it might go to...Ronald Colman? But Herbert Marshall was unusual in more than one way. So for me, the way he sounded... nailed it, spot on!\\nLoved The Razor\\'s Edge and now this gem.  Thank you very much!\\nSuper. Love Maugham.\\nThe last one was a tad weak tho.\\'\\nreally good film,i love old b/w films.\\nEnglish subtitles available on  Opensubtitles\\nFrom IMDb: \"The film is made from three short stories by W. Somerset Maugham. The first, \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" concerns the trials and tribulations a ne\\'er-do-well brother, Tom Ramsey, puts his prim-and-proper businessman brother, George Ramsey through. The escapades that drive George to absolute distraction eventually wins the hand of the world\\'s third richest girl, Margaret Vyne, for shiftless Tom; \"Winter Cruise\" finds the crew of a cargo boat becoming unglued by the endless chatter of a spinster passenger named Miss Reid. In a desperate attempt to silence the prattling busybody, the ship\\'s officers browbeat a French steward, Pierre into making love to her. The results provide some astounding surprises for the officers, Pierre, and, for certain, Miss Reid; In \"The Gigolo and the Gigolette\" segment, beautiful daredevil Stella Cotman, who entertains the jaded guests of a resort hotel by diving nightly from an eighty-foot platform into a flaming tank, is losing her nerve.\"\\nGood Movie thank you.\\nWinter Cruise was absolutely rivetting\\n\\n- via YTPak(.com)\\nAnother British film gem. Somerset Maugham is the icing on the cake. Thank you very much!\\nI enjoyed the first two films, I wasn\\'t too keen on the third. :-)\\nThank you for posting this! I have been a Maugham fan for the last 20 odd years or so. Through his writing Maugham endeared himself to millions around the world; I am not English but I can relate to him, and find through his writings a kindred spirit. The wide international appeal that Maugham continues to enjoy, must be something that the British can take a lot of pride in. It is through great authors like him that people around the world marveled about Britain and its outputs: literature, poetry, even industrial products. What makes a nation a world leader is its  ability to transcend the narrow confines of race, national boundary and ethnocentric strait jacket. I am sure, a great author like Maugham would never have subscribed to the ethnocentric comments that, sadly,\\xa0 I came across here. Nobility and cosmopolitanism were championed by some of his best known works!\\nGreat to see live footage of the man. The villa in the South of France looks absolutely enchanting!\\nGreat Somerset Mougham!\\nI like when Maugham appears - either as himself, or portrayed by lovely Herbert Marshall..such great fun!!\\nCharming characters, witty dialogue, delightful situations, and intelligent plots. \\xa0Who needs more to be entertained by film??? \\xa0Thank you, Arrinna, for uploading this!\\nThree great stories.\\nBrits are the best\\nMiss Reid reminds me of Hilda Ogden!\\nHeather Thatcher!\\nAnyone know the song they\\'re singing in the Winter Cruise? \"I know she likes me, i know she likes me, because she said so, she is my lily, she is my (rose?)\"\\nI love this movie.\\xa0 I agree\\xa0 I also love British movies... these British actors are so awesomely beautiful and handsome!\\nBut Tom is so unattractive.... \\xa0Sad.\\nThis is a great flick! \\xa0I am an Anglophile and a film buff, so this is a great find. \\xa0Thanks for these films!\\nReally, Beth! British boys haven\\'t worn \"knee-pants\" to school for years! Visit Glasgow or Belfast, they don\\'t talk like \"creampuffs\" there.\\nI had my doubts, but since I enjoyed W. Somerset Maugham\\'s \"The Razors Edge\" (the original, not the chessy remake with Bill Murray), I gave this one a chance. I\\'m glad I did. My favorite episode was \"Winter Cruise.\" My second was \"The Ant and the Grasshopper.\" Last but surely not least, \"Gigolo and Gigolette.\" I never realized how pretty Glynis Johns was. Give this one a watch. I think you\\'ll love it.\\n401875 1175 80 0 236\\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044586/\\nPT1H25M10S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::899\\nI\\'ve always felt Angelo Moore was a borderline Aspie.  He\\'s a great performer no doubt but\\nhe\\'s also very odd.\\nMassive respect for Fishbone.\\nI think the fact that Fishbone never got their due is what makes us ambassadors out of all of us who were passionately into their music and their live performances.\\xa0 Can you think of any other band where celebrities go out of their way to insert them into their work?\\n(a) Marlon Wayans wears a Fishbone shirt in the movie Mo\\' Money\\n(b) John Cusack wore Fishbone shirt in Say Anything and is seen holding one in Hot Tub Time Machine\\n(c) Tim Robbins wears a Fishbone shirt near the end of Bull Durham\\n(d) A character in the TV show Northern Exposure (Ed Chigliak) wears a Fishbone shirt in an episode\\n(e) ...and there\\'s probably many more.\\nFishbone...far superior musical construct...in every way!...soul stirring\\nGreat Music !! \"Should Have Been So Much Bigger\" !!? So True, Just Like The Guitarist Rocky George. He Should Be On Top List Of Rock / Punk / Metal Guitar Fans... He\\'s in My Top Five.Love The Music He Did With Suicidal Tendencies ! There\\'s Band and Artist That Don\\'t Get Big... SO WHAT !! IT\\'S GOOD MUSIC ANYWAY and IT INSPIRES ARTISTS And Me. How Many Good Artist Were Left In The Shade ???  If I Say Piggy D\\'Amour, Do Any Know Him ?? He Inspired Members of Sonic Youth, Killing Joke.. So FISHBONE !\\nOn KROQ There Is No Color Lines In The World Of Alternative, Funk, Grunge, Independent, Modern Rock, Modern Pop, New Wave, Or Punk EveryBody & I Mean EveryBody Can Listen To KROQ Even The African Americans Cause After 40 Years They Are Still The Station That FishBone, Onigo Boingo, Alanis Morrisette, & The Red Hot Chili Peppers True Superstars, & Another Thing That KROQ Do Is To Be Alternative Cause LA\\'s Already Got A Hip-Hop Radio Station & That Is A.M. Stereooooooo KDAY!\\nFirst, I apologize for the unforgivable sin of misspelling the station\\'s ID letters. Second, if alternative is the reason, then Fishbone would have fit right in. Why do these type stations play Cult of Personality by Living Colour? Note: Colour is spelled incorrect but correct.\\n\\nI am not sure their reason for not playing Fishbone. I will say the target audience for stations such as KROQ is white males. If there is any hint of racism, I see it coming more from the audience than the stations.\\n\\n\\n1st Of All It\\'s KROQ & Not KROC & 2nd The Real Why They Didn\\'t Play Run-D.M.C. & Public Enemy & The S1W\\'s It\\'s Because They\\'re Not Alternative Enough!\\nIs it the industry or the audience? Why is that on KROC  they play the Beastie Boys, but not Run DMC or Public Enemy who actually had moments where they played with white acts?\\nIt was kind of the same with Killing Joke. Another original band who transended a lot of genres but never made it huge but inspired a lot of artists.\\nAnd Mr. Bungle also came with an already established fan base from people who were really into Faith No More.\\nHas nothing to do with being Black. If anything  like a lot of Jazz, opera, classical, blues, funk. It doesn\\'t matter how good it is it\\'s whether it has commercial appeal. Look at Living Colour they made it huge and they were all black, and amazing musicians but they were also very accessible. Fishbone were like a lot of great bands like Voivod who were just so over everyone elses heads that the mainstream didn\\'t get them. As strange as Primus were they were also accessible.\\nIs it true that they\\'ll only play Sunless Saturday on a Saturday?\\nSaw them live last June and they were fucking amazing....no joke at all. One of the best live bands\\n@MrShayneOneill\\n\\nMaybe you should research the history rather than rely on something as removed from reality as your own imagination.\\n\\nIt\\'s been well documented that they were poorly managed and marketed in the 80\\'s.... a time when they had the best chance to make it big.\\nFishbone has no equal.  I have been fortunate enough to see them live dozens of times.  I am smart enough not to try to categorize them.  I am humble enough to appreciate them musically (yep-I\\'m a bass player who considers Norwood to be God-like).  I am not sure why anyone WANTS them to be a \"BIG\" mainstream corporate music indy whore-band.  I guarantee that they will be able to sustain themselves on loyal fans like ME!  PLUS-they aren\\'t a bunch of druggies waiting for their \"ROCK STAR\" exit...\\n@MrShayneOneill Living Colour got huge and they were all black dudes... Truth is I don\\'t agree that they are obscure. Everyone that grew up in the 90\\'s listening to good music knows about Fishbone! But they certainly deserved much more than being just a legendary alternative band.\\n@MrShayneOneill Of course you\\'re right, Red Hot Chilli Peppers blew up worldwide, and, frankly, they stole so much of their sound directly from fishbone.\\n@MrShayneOneill\\n\\nIt\\'s not just the race issue, it is the in that they aren\\'t a band that can be easily categorized. Their music was ahead of it\\'s time; but now I think they would fit right in. With so many acts out there that fuse different styles of music and black folks starting to be more accepted in what some consider \"non-black\" genres they could see deserved commercial success. I just listen to bands like TV on the Radio and Janelle Monae and I hear Fishbone.\\nbeen seeing them since 1985!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nThis movie was GREAT!  I can\\'t wait for the DVD.

No me pareció predecible para nada, el final es mortal y fue un giro inesperado completamente. Lo único que diría que es una cagada son los nenes que actúan como el ojete.\\ny nadie dice nada que paso con los 100 000 dolares, el boludo de darin deja que la ex se los lleve asi no mas? y que fue de la voz de la secuestradora, en que momento reparten el botin con la belen rueda\\n? y los nenes asi no mas se van con una desconocida sabiendo q su adorado padre los espera abajo para ir al colegio? jalado de los pelos el argumento, un poco ridiculo, no me gusto mucho esta peli.\\nel 90% de la pelicula se da en ese edificio.. pelicula barata, no gastaron ni en locaciones ni en balas ni en elenco, solo 4 gatos... de las peorcitas que le he visto a darin, una pena, gran actor....\\nsupongo rodar esta pelicula habra costado 10 mil dolares a lo mucho.\\nQué película berreta por favor! Muy predecible y muy DESAPROVECHADA. Cualquiera que haya visto una película de suspenso en su vida resuelve todo el misterio a los 20 minutos, muy poco original. Podrían haber hecho muchísimo más con la trama, pero la dejaron en algo que uno dice \"Eso es todo? Me están jodiendo?\". Hay películas hechas por gente a las que les gusta hacer películas, y hay películas hechas por gente que solo quiere ganar plata. Es muy fuerte la sensación de que, cuando habían escrito más o menos el final de la película, los tipos dijeron \"Bueno ya fue hacé que esto termine así y asá y listo, si total a esta altura la gente ya pagó la entrada\".\\nAlguien sabe cuales son las canciones de la pelicula?\\nmuy buena peli, le doy un 8...me gustó mas que \"Tesis sobre un homicidio\"\\nmuy buena peli, le doy un 8...me gustó mas que \"Tesis sobre un homicidio\"\\nexelente actor\\ntodos los que vimos la fabulosa \"Búsqueda Frenética\" con Harrison Ford, nos encontramos con argumento trillado con una esposa poco preocupada por sus hijos (obvio final muy incompleto). Vale la pena para verla cuando no hay nada para hacer. Lo mejor: el director y Ricardo Darin. Lo peor: podría decir que la película\\nEsa peli es basura\\nMe encanto! Excelente música, excelentes tomas, planos, muy buena, me dá nervios la situación....muy buenos actores le pongo un.9\\nPara mi muy buena, pero a lo último creo que si bien es un final algo previsible (si se piensa un poco) le faltó ajustar un par de cositas. Igualmente recomendable.\\nEl trailer te vende humo. Nunca pensé que iba a decir esto de una película que trabaja Darin, es MALISIMA. Y soy de las que ama el cine argentino!\\nEl personaje de Darin cansa... encaren chicos. Igualmente mi puntaje es de 6.75 de 10.\\nMuy buena película.... Yo apoyo al cine argentino. Como siempre un lujo...\\nEl trailer es mejor que la pelicula...\\nDarin volve a filmar con Campanella, por favor!!!\\nSolo a mi no me gustó esa película? QUE HORROR.\\nAl fin una película grabada en Argentina en que no dicen malas palabras... Que bueno! No todo está perdido todavía, ojalá siga así. Muy linda película, creo que pasan cosas similares en la realidad, y es como cuando uno se pregunta: ¿Hasta que tan lejos es capaz de llegar una persona sin importarle nada?\\nBlanco y negro la verdad sos un estupido/a contar el final eso es mala leche !!!! pobrecito !!\\ncomo que se parece a la pelicula a la pelicua de michael douglas, ni una palabra... puede ser? que la hija desaparece en la casa?\\nYa pasó tiempo. ¿La podrían pasar completa?

Esta muy pero muy buena la peli, le hace frente a cualquier produccion yankee. Y eso que yo no soy de ir a ver peliculas argentinas al cine porque soy de prejuzgar, pero me anime con esta y quede re copado.\\nEsta tendria que ir a representar a la Argentina a los Oscars y no Wakolda, que esta buena pero no le llega ni a los talones a Septimo.\\nNo digas boludeces. La mejor película del cine argentino sin dudas es Rambito y Rambón !\\nTe Quiero Belén !!!\\ny vos tenes mucha naturalidad cuando hablas, cuando te moves, hasta un chino se da cuenta que sos gay!\\nVos tampoco me cerras, no se si sos hombre o homosexual nose la verdad.\\nmuy mala peli che, la acabo de ver, muchas cosas inconclusas, todo predescible, .. la verdad para no verla.\\nboludo es luna de avellaneda,el secreto de sus ojos,la que hacia de chorro con gaston pauls,SIEMPRE LO MISMO DARIN!!! LABURA LADRON\\nLa película es la mejor del cine argentino! sin dudas!!\\nEs Mangeri, nabo.\\nPero, boludo... Desapareció a sus hijos!\\nAyer fui a verla! Resulta muy dificil subirle la apuesta a Darin. Luego de Carancho, Elefante blanco, Secreto de tus ojos o El hijo de la novia es dificil salir de la sala cien por cien satisfecho!\\nEn esta peli el guion resulta pobre para Darin xq sabemos puede rendir personajes mas complejos. No obstante me parece copado q el cine Nacional incurra en pelis de suspenso. La fotografia es buena. Los tiempos estan muy bien manejados. Quiza falta contenido en la trama. Aprobadisimaa en mi opinion\\nFui a verla, exelente. Lleva más de tres semanas en cartelera, cosa linda el cine nacional.\\nUna de las mejores peliculas que vi en el cine y en mi vida.\\nfue el padrastro...\\nPELICULON! LA VI AYER EN EL GOUMONT. BUENISIMA! TE PONE RE DURO TODO LO Q DURA\\nentonces anda a ver esa pelicula y deja de comentar pelotudeces aca\\nComento algo parecido en mi crítica, la cual te invito a que veas en mi canal. ;)\\nYo tambien! Viste SiN Señal ya?\\nBusquen \"Chantaje\" con Gerald Butler y van a ver la misma historia. Simplemente es una copia... de mala calidad.\\npersonalmente darin es un icono argentino temendo....y no hay con que darle.....la camara lo adora....y y belen rueda.....es un icono español tremendo tambien....la vi en unas cuantas...en su pais y en el mio y no hay con que darle....la pelicula tiene que ser MUY BUENA!!!!!!!! sin lugar a dudas\\n\\ndebe ser un peliculon\\nYo apoyo al cine argentino... ¿Y vos?\\nComparto tu comentario, si bien no conozco mucho de cine argentino (Soy mexicana :D) el tráiler es muy bueno. Hoy voy a ver la película y mañana subiré mi critica.

No porn it, just girls in sexy Alice in Wonderland costumes & a homicidal Jabberwocky killer.\\nwas great film\\nSeems really bad..\\nJust watched this movie and I loved it.

It looks like a high school film class made it. And the scenes where someone gets murdered is completley fake.

IDMB calls it Elfie Hopkins: Cannibal Hunters, but it\\'s really more like last 10 minute hunters. As a detective, she\\'s stupid and the guy does most of the work. Let\\'s just say cannibals as smart and rich as they were, wouldn\\'t be so obvious with what they are doing. Also, she blurts out killer like a dozen times right to these people\\'s face begging to be murdered.\\n\\nAlso, no need to watch this movie as the \"trailer\" is the movie i a two minute synopsis and you see every killing. Suffice to say, it was crap.\\nVery entertaining film!  There are a couple of contrived moments that don\\'t make sense; it would have been a stronger film without them. Primarily, the Gammons insisting upon parking in the driveway, in full view, instead of using their garage . . . no matter what it might be they were doing; and the last minute or so of the climax.  Also, sorry, but I can\\'t buy a 28-year-old as a teenager. That\\'ll take some suspension of disbelief.  Overall, though, a fun, somewhat over-the-top flick.\\nI loved this film aswell\\nshe is 28 not fucking middle aged\\nI loved it ur  like one of the only people who like it, half these peeps think its crap.\\nive watched this film its really good and worth watching!!\\nyh fuk the bitch\\njust watched the whole movie in 2min...but seems like a ok movie\\nDid anyone else notice that the girl playing Elfie looked middle aged rather then a teenager? She has a fat squat body like women have after menopause and her face has flabby cheeks and a weak chin and noticeable squint and frown lines. She is at least thirty. Why didn\\'t they hire someone younger and more talented to play the role? THEN it could have been a good movie. But she just ruins it. Completely. Maybe British people just don\\'t know how to cast good actors.\\nAh. Now Thats finally making some sense. I wondered why they wrote a whole movie for some talentless bitchy malcontent of a girl. I bet they wrote it to suit her personality. That scowl is probably how she looks in real life. I hope she overdoses soon.\\nGood for you, bitch.\\nNot the ones that made this sorry piece of trash. Its got some decent actors, but the script is pure shit, the girl in the lead is awful. Her face never changes. You have to look at that ugly sour expression for the whole hour. And where is her neck? Its like her shoulders swallowed the thing up. If you have to see it do it online for free. It doesn\\'t deserve to make a single dollar. Or pound.\\nlooks shit, seems ray winstone is just trynna give his daughter a boost because no one else wants her\\nGreat,  now I don\\'t have to watch the movie,  they showed it all.\\ndont fink so\\n*Do the British even think before making a movie?\\nDoes british even think before making a movie?\\nYeah giving everything away  including the \"twist\"....this is an awful trailer and more like the whole movie in 2 mins!\\nSHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT.......SHIT!!!\\nI saw that I wanted to leave in the first 5 mins. Everyone in the thearter burst out laughing at the ending.\\nIt had some some of the worst wtf is going on moments ive lost count.\\nSaw a special screenings of this.

In fact, he\\'s banned it from his and his daughter\\'s wife. It\\'s because some years ago, his wife cheated on him with her dentist at their daughter\\'s school pageant. Switch to a heavenly place where the director is instruction the ghosts, present (Andrea Roth) and past (Leslie Jordan) that Jack is their newest contact. But they are not the Christmas ghosts of Charles Dickens. In fact, they are pretty angry with him because he was told never to tell anyone what happened, and he wrote a book about it and embellished it pretty good. I guess the ghosts go visit a lost soul every year for over 2000 years now and Dickens was the only one who broke the rules and wrote about it. Anyway, Christmas Past is getting really tired of going back to the past, and wants to be alive again, so he breaks the rules, and strands Jack back in his past, so present is sent to the past to find them and try to bring them home. Turns out that he doesn\\'t want to go back, and it turns into a brawl. If he doesn\\'t get back by midnight, he\\'ll cease to exist.\\n\\nThis modern take on the Christmas Carol story is a bit loony. The ghosts are normal people, and not at all like the traditional story goes. And things get all screwed up and twisted around in weird way. Since it\\'s Tom Arnold, it\\'s a bit silly. Ok, not a bit, it\\'s a lot silly. This is good, maybe for a single viewing, but it\\'s not something you\\'re going to watch again and again. As much as I love the Christmas Carol story, I just can\\'t get into this version. It was a nice try to freshen it and make it new again, but it\\'s just so stupid that it doesn\\'t cut it. I don\\'t recommend this, unless you\\'ve never seen it, and you\\'re a Tom Arnold fan.\\n\\nFor hundreds more of Ed\\'s \"Christmas on TV Project\" holiday film reviews, come visit us at:  http://www.edsreview.com/eds-christmas-on-tv-project-2010-2011\\nPT4M26S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::913\\nRIP Ricky Bruch\\n9223 14 0 0 1\\nun film di e.b.clucher\\n\\nla voce narrante è di pino locchi,doppiatore di giuliano gemma\\nPT3M9S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::914\\n2908 8 1 0 0\\nSubscribe to MovieTrailersByVD: http://bit.ly/QcNd7j\\nMore clips, photos, and news: http://bit.ly/R6lQQe\\n\\nFollow Videodetective.com on facebook http://www.facebook.com/VideoDetective\\nFollow Videodetective.com on twitter http://twitter.com/VideoDetective\\n\\nSubscribe to GameTrailersByVD: http://bit.ly/RNaDlR\\nSubscribe to TVPromosByVD: http://bit.ly/Plupqf\\nSubscribe to MusicVideosByVD: http://bit.ly/Te5RuH\\n\\nDirector: Rory Kennedy\\nCast: Robert F.

Les Raimu, charpin, et même Orane Demazis et Pierre Fresnay (même si pour ces deux derniers on peut juger leur jeu, un peu trop \"théatral\") doivent se retourner dans leurs tombes.\\nJ\\'ai énormément aimé ces deux films. Ils reprennent une trilogie culte et la respectent. Une image sublime et des dialogues savoureux, je ne comprends pas comment autant de personnes peuvent cracher dessus alors que c\\'est une bonne reprise et que ça permet de redécouvrir les vieux films. Car oui, c\\'est grâce à ces deux film que j\\'ai été voir les originaux. Alors la bande annonce peut ne pas donner envie certes, mais les films sont vraiment bon et les acteurs aussi ! Alors les puristes s\\'ils vous plaît, ouvrez un peu vos esprits et essayer de regarder les reprises comme de nouveaux films. Bref, laissez leurs leurs chances  :-)\\n(Je précise que ce sont mes grands-parents qui m\\'ont prêté leur coffret \"Marius et Fanny \" , mes grands-parents qui sont de grands grands fans du travail de Marcel Pagnol)\\nahhhh I don\\'t understand a word, that is soo sad :\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'(\\nDes parisiens qui parle le marseillais ...

J\\'ai vu le fim avant-hier pourtant. Pour l\\'instant que Marius donc. Pas mal, sauf l\\'accent de Personnaz...Une catastrophe.\\nAuteuil est à la hauteur, comme toujours !\\nFanny vaut le coup ?\\nnon marius, fanny et césar\\n\\nCar dans marius elle friquote avec lui et se retrouve enceinte et dans fanny on voit à peine marius.\\n\\nbref, je n\\'ai pas aimé, Auteuil est magnifique dans ce role ainsi que Darroussin et Chazel mais sinon très moyen\\nNon, l\\'ordre est Fanny Marius César\\nJ\\'adore la musique de ce film ! on l\\'entend a partir de 1:05 minutes si vous savez comment elle s\\'appelle ...dites moi ! :)\\nDommage que l\\'accent soit si mal imité...\\nLes films originaux restent des chef d\\'oeuvres c\\'est indiscutable, mais il faut savoir s\\'en détacher car ces 2 nouvelles versions méritent amplement d\\'être appréciées à leur juste valeur. Surtout qu\\'elles ont été réalisés par un fan de Pagnol. Honnêtement, ces 2 films sont magnifiques et bien fait en tout point. Il faut les voir en oubliant les originaux.\\nd\\'abord Marius puis Fanny\\nRemu reste Remu. Irremplaçable.\\nJ\\'ai lu les oeuvres de Marcel Pagnol en ce  moment,je ne m\\'en lasse pas de les relire plusieurs fois\\nCa m\\'a l\\'air d\\'être un beau film !\\n\\nJe comprends pas personnellement cette lubie de faire des remakes !!! Manque d\\'idées ? Pourtant les \"Jean de Florette\" et \"Manon des Sources\" de Berry sont de vrais chef d’oeuvres mais bon... Yves Montand quoi ! Je penses pas non plus que le problème vienne du fait que les acteurs soient marseillais de souches puisque dans la trilogie originale Pierre Fresnay était parisien (et oui !!!) mais lui avait bossé son rôle !!! La y a zéro marseillais et on dirait une mauvaise pub pour l\\'huile d\\'olive !\\nLa trilogie originale ;)\\nOuais bon l\\'accent c\\'est couci couça quand même..\\nVictoire Belezy n’aura aucun mal à faire oublier Orane Demazis (accent pointu et jeu beaucoup trop théâtral) de la version originale… Quant à Daniel Auteuil et Jean-Pierre Darroussin – même si tous deux sont excellents – c’est une vraie gageure de reprendre les rôles interprétés par des monstres comme Raimu et Fernand Charpin…\\n\\nle premier de la trilogie: Marius\\nelle est prévue pour 2014\\nAu secour c\\'est quoi cet accent marseillais\\nJ\\'espère alors qu\\'ils n\\'attendront pas 20 ans pour que le acteurs aient tous l\\'âge des rôles au moment de l\\'histoire... ;-))\\nNon elle sortira plus tard apparement :)\\nEt la troisième partie, CESAR, elle est passée à la trappe ??  :-((\\nje suis une fan inconditionnelle de Mr PAGNOL!J\\'ai regardé en boucle tous ses films!j\\'ai toutes ses cassettes mais...Chapeau bas Mr AUTEUIL quoiqu\\'en dise certains puristes,il a relevé le défi haut la main!J\\'ai aimé la FILLE DU PUISATIER de Mr AUTEUIL avec autant  de force que celui de Mr PAGNOL !Ce sont tous les deux de grand réalisateur mais d\\'époques différentes! Et de ce fait je vais courir voir ce nouveau chef-d\\'oeuvre!!!!\\n\\n\\nDaniel Auteuil joue magnifiquement bien mais rien ne remplacera le jeu de Raimu dans Marius. Cela doit être mon côté marseillais et puriste des vieux films de Marcel Pagnol mais ce film ne va pas me plaire... Je vous conseille de voir la vraie trilogie marseillaise avant la nouvelle.\\nD\\'abord ,l\\'inoubliable \" Galinette \" , après la  Fille du Puisatier ,maintenant la trilogie marseillaise , je m\\'en régale d\\'avance ,merci Mr Auteuil...!\\nLes œuvres de Marcel Pagnol sont magnifiques et je conseille de les lire avant de regarder les films! Daniel Auteuil a du courage de reprendre Marius et Fanny car les films successivement de 1931, 1932 et 1936 sont de purs chefs d\\'oeuvre!!

Pour retenir Marius, pressenti pour un engagement sur un navire d\\'exploration, Fanny lui dévoile son amour pour lui et parvient à attiser sa jalousie en provoquant une vive dispute entre Marius et un vieil ami de César, le maître-voilier Panisse, qui, beaucoup plus âgé, courtise Fanny. Partagé entre l\\'appel de la mer et son amour pour Fanny, Marius renonce à son projet et finit par s\\'unir à Fanny qui s\\'offre à lui. Mais, alors que César et Honorine, la mère de Fanny, sont prêts à les marier, Marius est repris par sa folie de la mer. Poussé par Fanny qui se sacrifie par amour pour Marius, ce dernier monte à bord du navire qui part, abandonnant Fanny bouleversée, qui retient ses larmes et cache à César le départ de son fils.\\n\\nSynopsis du film FANNY :\\nFanny, amoureuse et abandonnée, apprend qu\\'elle attend un enfant de Marius.

On Christmas Eve she gets a last minute call to come into work. Although she would much rather spend the holiday with Trevor, she can\\'t turn down the money and the client has promised to make it worth her while. Shannon is dispatched to pick up Fred Nickells, an eccentric client caught up in the holiday spirit. Shannon\\'s orders are to drive Fred where he wants and he wants to go anywhere and everywhere in the city, handing out money wherever he goes.\\n\\n\\n\\nFred\\'s generosity attracts the interest of local television news reporter Peter Simon, desperate for the big story that will get him promoted. Peter picks up on the trail of stunned New Yorkers left in Fred\\'s wake and talks him into doing an interview. At the same time Peter and Shannon feel the sparks of attraction. Fred finally reveals that he\\'s got an ulterior motive - namely, that Shannon is the long-lost daughter he never got to meet.

It hasn\\'t \"caused controversy\" because \\'it\\'s a new word\\'; it\\'s because the word itself is meaningless. Only the idiots at Webster (read: the twats behind the bastardisation of the English language) consider it a word. The prefix \"ir\" and suffix \"less\" each mean the same thing. And for the love of Christ, stop using the word \"wit\" -- you clearly lack any sense of the word.\\nIt\\'s quite clear that you\\'re new to the internet. \"Marked for spam\" -- good one.\\n@franka64 Irregardless is an informal term commonly used in place of regardless or irrespective, which has caused controversy since it first appeared in the early twentieth century. The mental picture I have of you is a \" 90lb. Erkel look alike. You vent your spleen behind the anonymity of the internet. I write for fun as well as enlightenment. I enjoy  humourous witticisms, which you and your lover, TheSirPrize, sadly lack. Don\\'t bother with a reply, it\\'s marked for Spam.\\n@gdawsey Irregardless? That\\'s not even a word. This nationalistic shit where cuntscabs go back and forth talking about their country\\'s history as though they themselves were a part of it is just breathtaking to watch/read. Thanks for filling the comment section up with your crap.\\nSharpe is shaved!\\n@gdawsey cont. Also entertainment, and intellectual stimulation. I don\\'t enjoy conversing with someone devoid of humor and hides behind the anonymity of the internet to make personal attacks. You use this medium to say things you would not say face to face. Especially if it is my face, you are facing. Lighten up, get a sense of humor use wit to make your points. To date, your writing style makes me believe you could act as one of those officers in the series. Natural talent,  Old Boy.\\n@TheSirPrise I hate rap. It was a weak attempt at grade school poetry. My brain is still fried from lack of sleep. Irregardless. What territories did we lose. Napi was defeated at Waterloo, or soon would be. The war was politically inspired by opportunists, and recieved poor support. We had an army in name only as we felt safe behind the big moat called the Atlantic. We were not decimated. That means you killed 1 out of 10. You can\\'t count that high. I engage in comment section for knowlege.\\n@gdawsey Did you just try to rap? Anyway, moving on, I didn\\'t mention anything about Florida however, Florida was just one of the few territories that we didn\\'t have when we invaded you, we occupied your land and forced you in to a peace treaty. What makes this worse is that you\\'re not even going to bother verify my statements, you\\'re clearly not interested in knowledge. How very sad.\\n@TheSirPrise Are you able to engage in debate, using humor and wit? Maybe your personal attacks happen, because your full of shit.\\n\\nGo for the chuckle\\n\\nShow me your wit\\n\\nPersonal attacks, don\\'t make you wise\\n\\nThey warn me to search for the brown in your eyes\\n\\nThe first indication that your full of s&%t.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe didn\\'t lose territory, check out Florida.The rest of your argument sounds like \"Sour grapes\".\\n\\n\\n@gdawsey corrections-Considering; one.

You didn\\'t have to dust that won off did you?\\n@gdawsey The old battle of new Orleans trick is it? I\\'m not surpirsed someone as stupid as you would bother to pull that one out. That battle had nothing to do with the war and was the only few you actually managed to win. That\\'s why it is glamourised so much, because it\\'s one of the few battles you won. LOL! Don\\'t tell me you feel the least bit pathetic in knowing that you actually had to glamourise a battle (not even part of the war) and was one of the few you won. I feel bad for you.\\n@gdawsey You can\\'t just look at it as \\'well we only achieved a few of our many objectives of the war so there fore we won, even when your entire army was decimated, your capital burned to the ground and most of your territories seized.\\' Because that is clearly retarded. Face it, the UK had no interest in continuing the war (as there was still business left in Europe) and the US took such a pounding that they hadn\\'t the funds, heart or men to fight anymore.\\n@gdawsey \"United King Dummians?\" ho ho, nice one, I can tell you had to use your last three brain cells for that come back.\\n@TheSirPrise Very puzzeling. When the smoke cleared, we still had what we started with; & the United King Dummians, stopped hijacking our sailors. Invading Canada, was a bad  idea. Most of congress, were happy, at the failure, they just couldn\\'t say so. Oh, bye the bye, are you familiar with a General Packingham? While on Holiday (1814), he visited New Orleans on a group plan, as he had 15,000 or so friends with him. He did leave in good spirits though. He was in a barrel of rum I believe. Ta!\\n@TheSirPrise So? What do they call you all? United King Dummians?\\n@malechuvinistxy Only the rich could offord basic school back in those days,, remember Richard came from the ranks, he was an orphan to a prostitute so he had no money therefore no education resulting in the problem he has with maps but he is slowly learning.\\n@TheSirPrise you can call me names all you want but one thing I can say for myself is that I dont send nasty hateful sounding messages to people I have never met. I wasnt baiting anyone, and I am perfectly open to being corrected, if need be, but I would rather it by a pleasant person. have a good night.\\n@wakeoftheflood2 Also it\\'s not \\'England\\' it\\'s the UK. Don\\'t you know the difference?\\n@wakeoftheflood2 1) It\\'s obvious you\\'re a troll, but I\\'ll take the bait. 2) The USA didn\\'t win the war of 1812. The United States invasion (with their entire army) was constantly repelled by a small garrison of British infantrymen and Canadian militia, most of your territory fell under British control, your capital was burned to the ground, your forces shattered and you were forced in to a peace treaty when you sought to win the war, hardly a victory is it?\\ncouple of points- very rare that you actually see the chosen men loading the bakers, and it seems so damn easy to spit that ball into the barrel, what it it a bb?\\n\\nalso no wonder the US won the war of 1812, england had been fighting napoleon for 10yrs, otherwise I doubt we would\\'ve stood a chance\\n@Ohloveeh They were sent either back to england or elsewhere I can\\'t remember which\\nHow come Sharpe\\'s new soldiers/officers are almost always regular infantrymen?\\nWhat happened to the rest of the 95th Rifle\\'s?

Why isn\\'t his older stuff and any new material available on YouTube or even a paid service?\\nHOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?\\nNever ever watched documentaries b4 while ùchannel surfing saw Ralph Zavadil. I watched jack-a cuz my boyfriend. don\\'t like ppl eating nasty things, but like stunts. When I saw Ralph his laugh, his personality, body language and how he presented his show. Totally reminded me of STEVE-O and Some of the guys on Jack-a. So had look up information on the jack-a Cast. AND STEVE-O his father was a presidency of the South American division of Cola. Moved around alot his Childhood residencies include Canada, in the 1980\\'s-1990\\'s he lived in Toronto.I\\'m sure he can across Ralphs show. Just putting it out there.\\nThis documentary made me want to get out there again and live life. Screw the 9 to 5 bs:)\\nOne of the best documentary\\'s ever! I can watch this over and over.\\nHe got in an empty bathtub with puppies and poured chocolate sauce on them, and himself. He\\'s an amazing guy and I\\'ve never saw him be anything but nice to his pets. He\\'s got a huge heart for his animals, and nothing was ever done to hurt them. If you look at the shit thats on tv, that scene wouldn\\'t even make you blink. There\\'s nothing wrong about it.\\nwhats the name of the song at 2:28 ??\\n\\nThe song is called Crystal Cat-Dan Deacon\\nMy kids just had their bikes tuned up by The Bicycle Doctor aka Cap\\'n Video.

This documentary, along with MICROCOSMOS, and the two aforementioned novels completely changed my perception regarding animal and plant cross-species communication abilities (like a wild shark that \"asks\" a diver to remove a hook from its mouth or fin).

Chemical fertilizers and pesticides turn soil into dead dirt incapable of retaining water and nourishing plant material. Once the soil dies, as is now the case,(except for organic farms and landscapes,) it takes more and more chemical fertilizers and pesticides to sustain diminishing plant life, meanwhile, we are poisoning ourselves, polluting our drinking water, and destroying the planet, while Monsanto and the big chemical industry makes billions and has little reason to change.\\nThe soil continues to excite me even after 37+ years as a soil scientist!\\xa0 When I sit and look out at a landscape I do feel the energetic humming of\\xa0the biotic population under foot.\\xa0 The world depends on the soil and is nothing without it.\\xa0 Be vigilant in your care of this precious resource.\\nGreatly important educaton is in this feature Symphony of Soil.

Using a captivating mix of art and science, the film shows that soil is a complex living organism, the foundation of life on earth. Yet most people are soil-blind and \"treat soil like dirt.\" Through the knowledge and wisdom revealed in this film, we can come to respect, even revere, this miraculous substance, and appreciate that treating the soil right can help solve some of our most pressing environmental problems. In addition to the feature film, there are several short  films, Sonatas of the Soil, that delve deeply into soil-related topics, and several short clips, Grace Notes, that are available to stream on the film\\'s website.\\n\\nProduced and Directed by Deborah Koons Garcia\\n\\n\\nLOGLINE: Symphony of the Soil explores the evolution and importance of soil in today\\'s world.\\n\\nTAGLINE: Discover the life beneath your feet.\\n\\nhttp://www.symphonyofthesoil.com\\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2229399/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\\nPT2M18S\\nhd\\nMovieID::::940\\nThe mind and the gut are connected, a healthy stomach is a healthy mind, that\\'s why when we feel sad we stop eating or when we don\\'t want to face reality we hurt ourselves by drinking too much alcohol or sugar hurting our gut bacteria, all our of body and mind.

The difference is that in this production the two protagonist, Bette Davis ( Ellen Garfield ) and George Brent ( Curt Devlin ), working in competing newspapers . Bette Davis is well on stage . She found the exact tone of the character - a professional career start willing to prove it is a good reporter .\\nGeorge Brent is the lover while antagonist. The actor plays an experienced journalist, full of tricks to get the information you want .\\nDirector of Front Page Woman, Michael Curtiz (Casablanca), has the merit of raising the speed of the newsrooms of major newspapers, combining moments of tension and comedy. The hilarious scenes , such as Ellen be induced colleague Curt disclose the false trial verdict .\\n1927 15 1 0 4\\nPurchase Front Page Woman here: http://bit.ly/18SVWsq\\n\\nExtra! Extra! Laugh all about it! Bette Davis and George Brent star in this comic battle of the sexes filled with good-natured rivalry and romance.

But a nearby apartment fire and a mysterious murder will soon test their investigative skills...and their feelings for each other. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz would go on to become one of the most prolific filmmakers of all time, helming more than 170 movies in Europe and the United States. He was nominated for the Best Director Academy Award® twice in the same year (1938) and won the Oscar® five years later for Casablanca.\\n------\\n1,000+ Rare films, TV movies, and series on DVD direct from the Studio. http://www.warnerarchive.com\\nPT3M31S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::948\\nI forgot they did this in the 90’s.

Are you serious?! Oh man...!\\nIf he was enough, they could\\'ve had HIM voice the entire cast of the show! (Then again, there were only 5 or 6 people voicing the entirety of Thundercats and I loved THAT too!)\\nBut Frank Welker? Ehhh...I got to admit it...in my adult age, his voice gets a little annoying EVEN when he\\'s just doing creature noises!\\nQuartuvLarry: I couldn\\'t agree more, but seeing as how Lorenzo is no longer with us, I think they\\'ve probably found the best possible person to voice Garfield.  Frank Welker is the same guy who voiced Bo, Sheldon, and Booker in US Acres.  Even though he\\'s clearly not Lorenzo Music, I think he does a MUCH better job on Garfield\\'s voice than Bill Murray did...  Lorenzo Music\\'s voice is next to impossible to imitate, and this is about as close as it gets, imho.\\nIt\\'s just not Garfield without Lorenzo Music!!!\\nWhoever\\'s idea it was must\\'ve been fired...\\nHello megdf328,\\nThanks for contacting us.\\nGarfield Gets Real is now Available on DVD.

Glad to see there are still people out there than don\\'t have to discuss posts on youtube with phrases like \"f**k you\" or \"your an idiot\". :)\\n@grimyguerilla and maybe it has always been.\\n@SkyPry Ok SkyPry, sorry I overreacted because your comment seemed, for me, to apologize the white slave trade as africans were involved in selling human beings like stock. i think we both know, that this can\\'t be upheld likewise neither do whites own the monopoly on it. egypt is as good an example as any other else. sure human trafficking is still an issue, and slavery is alive and kicking in the postmodern world. but nowadays its more a question of socioeconomic background than ethnicity.\\n@grimyguerilla Relax \"grimyguerilla\".  It goes without saying that slavery has been around for a very, very long time.  I thought that was just common knowledge.  It seems you misunderstood me.  I am not saying that the colonial Americans were innocent by any means.  All I said was that white people did not pioneer slavery.  Just like you said \"ever heard of Greece, Rome or Egypt\".  That being said, we should stop dwelling in the past and focus on fixing the human trafficking problems of today.\\n@SkyPry thats some stupid comment on the issue... actually slavery is much older than the US... ever heard of greece, rome or egypt ? those african slaves sold by africans have been debtslaves or people taken prisoners in local wars. anyway, what youre trying to say is, that because africans participated in the slavetrade whites are innocent ? who profitted most of it ? did you know that the transatlantic slavetrade only summed up to 15 million people ? who owned the plantations ?\\n@Halcyonwanderer the video\\n@statelybird3 But how often are those parents successful? =(\\nhookers and the homeless :D\\nObama don\\'t have to give me a got d**n thing--I will get that s**t myself.

I don\\'t disagree with what you\\'re saying at all. I\\'m just tired of hearing hwo it was about slavery. Lincoln wanted to send them all back to Africa, if I recall correctly and that\\'s why Liberia was set up in west Africa, to repatriate these people.\\nYes, that\\'s very true, but it wasn\\'t truly white people who made their money from the slave trade. It was the Jews. Do some research and you will find that to be the deeper truth. Dutch Jews are who profited most from the Trans Atlantic slave trade.\\nThe American Civil war was about states rights and not slavery, people need to stop believe the fairy tale lies they learn in grammar school. Think about it, since whitey hates blacks so much and wants to keep them down. With that in mind, do you really think any whites would\\'ve fought to free blacks? The North just wanted more control through federalization and the South wanted more autonomy as was the intent in the Constitution. I personally think the wrong side lost.\\nThat isn\\'t true, since there is no popular vote in this country. The electoral votes are the ONLY ones that count. So it is possible for a man to lose the electoral vote but win the popular vote.\\nEuropeans purchased African slaves from other Africans; Africans \"kidnapped\" other africans and sold them to white people. White people, alone, are not responsible for slavery in the western world. Secondly, if I remember correctly, it was white people who fought and died in the civil war to free black people. And it was white people in congress who passed the Civil Rights Act. And it\\'s white people who passed affirmative action.\\nDon\\'t get the impression that you will ever get the upper hand one the white race. We brought you out of the jungle, taught you how to use tools, and put real roofs over your heads and this is the thanks we get. Furthermore Obama is a puppet for white interests he has no real power and half white anyways his good half.\\n@fruitsofnews: the first track is the theme from \"Sweet Sweetback\\'s Baadasssss Song;\" the second is \"This Ain\\'t America;\" the third (bluesy) track is from the movie \"Watermelon Man,\" all written by Melvin Van Peebles.\\nI want to see this.\\nIn what age range? And what\\'s the comparison to Caucasians?\\nBut Africa has a history of white \\'intermixture\\', too. I heard some stories of border disputes where white South Africans were barred from crossing because the border patrols assumed the passports and documents were faked (since an African HAD to be black.) It doesn\\'t mean you\\'re wrong, it just means that they weren\\'t necessarily wrong to list an African as white just because he was an African.\\nOkay, if you think that America is not one of the least racist countries in the world, I am curious as to what you think is a country with little racism.\\nWell if that man existed (Which I doubt severely), than he probably did it for the bonuses that come with being a minority and looking white. His family could get into college easier, they wouldn\\'t have to suffer any racism, and he could essentially reap the benefits of both races. btw, if they listed him as a white man automatically, wouldn\\'t that just fucking prove my point. That Egypt is industrial because it\\'s a white, European country that happens to be on a certain continent.\\nI\\'m not sure if we where considered \"Developed\" at that time. I mean hell, before WW2 America was really just considered a backwater nation.\\nAnd we were the only developed nation to base our slavery on race, and keep that \"institution\" as late as we did.\\nMore black males in prison than in colleges. Hmm, do you see a problem with this?\\nNo, it was a response that didn\\'t get posted properly. I was just stating the fact that we didn\\'t invent slavery. I\\'m not saying it was right. I\\'m just saying, we weren\\'t the first ones to do such a thing. Israelites, Africans, Indians (Eastern and Western), and even the Japanese, all have forms of slavery that where involved in their pasts. It\\'s just something that we need to get over, and move away from, if we want to advance as a nation.\\nParents? You must mean \"parent\" , since over 70% of black children are born out of wedlock. Maybe black fathers should stop abandoning their families.\\nThere are records of black slaves in Africa before the slave trade market was even thought of. Those where the consequences of war in Africa. When a tribe lost a war to another tribe, the loosing side was enslaved. The European slave trade was started, by buying, already-enslaved Africans from Africa.\\nI know you don\\'t really believe that :-)\\ngo back to europe. if i was ashamed of my past i would teach my kids different and to do so i  would have to put down another to make my family look better. sound familiar,\"I  think there is mere crime by Black People...\"\\nu will NEVER understand and u don\\'t want tot(ignorance=racism)... you are so brainwashed by the media and movies... i\\'ve never commited a major crime except traffic violations... you just showed your intellegence level by generalizing black folks... so by your preachings, you eat people and touch kids...\\nAmerica is one of the least racist countries in the world.

Because I know the answer. Africans are just as much to blame for slavery as the dutch are. FACT: Africans sold themselves to the Dutch.\\nAs soon as you realize that many whites aren\\'t pure evil, you will realize how hateful and devilish your hatespeech is. Simple minded hate won\\'t prevail. Don\\'t think for a second that I\\'m the guy whipping you with metal tipped whip. btw, I\\'m clean when it comes to slavery and oppression, Eastern Europe had barely any slaves, and my roots come from a village in Poland, and a small castle in Ireland, Ireland being a poor ass country at the time. My slate is clean, how about yours?\\nit would be pointless as u and ur kind only understand LIES and bullshit, when speaking truthfull u ppl never understand.  Evil never prevails for long, go and watch tv, this couple hundred of years u ppl have bin on the up side of thing is just a drop in the bucket to whats in store for you. THINK 2 URSELF where were white ppl b4 they started to prosper.  Answer: the same day u will b when judgement day, in hell!  ur days r numbered caveman\\nIf you explain yourself clearly, I will be able to listen, but as of now, your ghettoitis is clearly showing. Should I talk in caps calling you a black panther porchmonkey too? You should know though, all white people know in some degree that they fucked over the world and yes, we are proud of it. You know why? BECAUSE WE WIN EVERY TIME. You can call me a \"kkkraker,\" but I\\'ll just go back to owning land and people. You can rise the highest position of power and we\\'ll still be more powerful.\\ni 4got to add\\n\\n...BEIOTH!\\nblack on white racism...HAAAAA HAAAA HHHAAAA HHAAAAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\nim riled up cuz i gave u some knowledge, ur white so thats y u act this way!

Estranged from his wealthy New York family, his life is one of hard-living excess and selfish pursuits as a musician on the make. But when he discovers that his terminally ill father (Academy Award® nominee Richard Jenkins, Burn After Reading) is preparing to remove himself from life-support, Jonathan faces one of the most challenging and emotionally tumultuous 48 hours of his young life.\\n\\nForced to reconnect with his kin, mother Rachel (Academy Award® nominee Anne Archer, Fatal Attraction) and uptight sister Karen (Jessica Brown Findlay, Downton Abbey), Jonathan attempts to reconcile his rebellious past, rekindling an all-but-forgotten friendship with Emily (Academy Award® nominee Amy Adams, American Hustle) and crossing paths with a young hospital patient offering plenty of sage advice.\\n\\nAlso featuring Academy Award® winner Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) and Academy Award® nominee Terence Howard (Hustle & Flow), Lullaby takes a deep and thought-provoking look into the heart of human compassion.\\nPT2M28S\\nsd\\nMovieID::::993\\nThe US military is an abomination. The sooner it gets itself kicked out of the countries it occupies violently the better and that could not happen a day soon.\\nawsome movie trailer seems boring but its truly shows how it is out there to be a solider\\nKorengal is a sequel to Restrepo, a 2010 American documentary film about the Afghanistan war. Korengal, like Restrepo, is largely comprised of footage shot by Junger and Hetherington while embedded with American troops during the Afghanistan war. Junger had originally planned to create a 3 x 60-minutes series called Battle Company, as previously reported, but instead has whittled the material down to a single film. The film is due to be released in theaters in New York on May 30, 2014, with a pay-VOD release following in September 2014.\\n145372 164 38 0 7\\nKorengal Official Trailer directed by Sebastian Junger.\\n\\nFrom May 2007 to July 2008, Junger and his colleague Tim Hetherington chronicled the deployment of a platoon of US troops in the deadliest valley in Afghanistan, and the experiences they captured became RESTREPO. Constructed by Junger from entirely unused, never-before-seen footage, KORENGAL picks up where the previous film left off: the same men, the same valley, the same commanders, but a very different look at the experience of war. The film explains how war works, what it feels like and what it does to the young men who fight it. As one soldier cheers when he kills an enemy fighter, another looks into the camera and asks if God will ever forgive him for all of the killing he has done. As one soldier grieves the loss of his friend in combat, another explains why he misses the war now that his deployment has ended and admits he would go back to the front line in a heartbeat. Every bit as intense and affecting as RESTREPO, KORENGAL gives audiences a front row view into the world of combat.\\n\\nRelease Date: 2014\\nDirector: Sebastian Junger\\nCast: Juan \\'Doc Restrepo, Dan Kearney, Misha Pemble-Belkin\\nGenre: Documentary, History\\nCountry.
